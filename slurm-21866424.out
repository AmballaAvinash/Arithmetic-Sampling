03/28/2024 09:49:46 - INFO - __main__ -   Predictions: ['1969 was the year that Van Morrison released "Brown Eyed Girl". "Brown Eyed Girl" is a rock song. Rock is a genre of music that is popular with men. Thus, the title of "Brown Eyed Girl" applies to a minority of women worldwide. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\n', '10% of women worldwide have an average title for their first single. However, 10% is the same as 0.1. 0.1 x 10,000,000 is 100,000. 100,000 is not the same as 500,000. Therefore, at least 500,000 women worldwide have an average title for their first single', '17.80% of the population of the United States is female. Thus, a minority of women worldwide would have listened to "Brown Eyed Girl". So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\n', "2,221 songs have been played on the radio more than 500 times since 1967. 2,221/2,221 = 1. This means that there is only a 1 in 2,221 chance that a random song has been played more than 500 times since 1967. Thus, it is unlikely that the title of Van Morrison's most played song applies to a minority", "70% of Van Morrison's most played songs are by female authors. Thus, less than 30% of women worldwide own this title. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\n"]

torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.50 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 15.77 GiB of which 113.12 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 15.66 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 15.20 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 101.46 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
