Question: Would a pear sink in water?
Reasoning: The density of a pear is about 0.6 g/cm3, which is less than water. Objects less dense than water float. Thus, a pear would float. So the answer is no.
Answer: no
Question: Hydrogen’s atomic number squared exceeds number of Spice Girls?
Reasoning: Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1. 1 squared is 1. There are 5 Spice Girls. Thus, Hydrogen’s atomic number squared is less than 5. So the answer is no.
Answer: no
Question: Could Brooke Shields succeed at University of Pennsylvania?
Reasoning: Brooke Shields went to Princeton University. Princeton University is about as academically rigorous as the University of Pennsylvania. Thus, Brooke Shields could also succeed at the University of Pennsylvania. So the answer is yes.
Answer: yes
Question: Do hamsters provide food for any animals?
Reasoning: Hamsters are prey animals. Prey are food for predators. Thus, hamsters provide food for some animals. So the answer is yes.
Answer: yes
Question: Could a llama birth twice during War in Vietnam (1945-46)?
Reasoning: The War in Vietnam was 6 months. The gestation period for a llama is 11 months, which is more than 6 months. Thus, a llama could not give birth twice during the War in Vietnam. So the answer is no.

In this chapter we will discuss how to evaluate the process that goes into making an argument. Evaluating arguments includes identifying the fallacies and methods of arguing, and what criteria we should use when evaluating whether or not an argument is good. Being familiar with these will enable one to be less vulnerable to fallacious arguments, to assess arguments accurately, and thus help one become skilled in making sound arguments.\n# What Makes an Argument?\nThe term argument refers to a way of communicating an idea or point of view.

In this chapter we will discuss how to evaluate the process that goes into making an argument. Evaluating arguments includes identifying the fallacies and methods of arguing, and what criteria we should use when evaluating whether or not an argument is good. Being familiar with these will enable one to be less vulnerable to fallacious arguments, to assess arguments accurately, and thus help one become skilled in making sound arguments.\n# What Makes an Argument?\nThe term argument refers to a way of communicating an idea or point of view.

In this chapter we will discuss how to evaluate the process that goes into making an argument. Evaluating arguments includes identifying the fallacies and methods of arguing, and what criteria we should use when evaluating whether or not an argument is good. Being familiar with these will enable one to be less vulnerable to fallacious arguments, to assess arguments accurately, and thus help one become skilled in making sound arguments.\n# What Makes an Argument?\nThe term argument refers to a way of communicating an idea or point of view.

In this chapter we will discuss how to evaluate the process that goes into making an argument. Evaluating arguments includes identifying the fallacies and methods of arguing, and what criteria we should use when evaluating whether or not an argument is good. Being familiar with these will enable one to be less vulnerable to fallacious arguments, to assess arguments accurately, and thus help one become skilled in making sound arguments.\n# What Makes an Argument?\nThe term argument refers to a way of communicating an idea or point of view.
