Thus, the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nConclusion\nAs noted, this book is about improving students', '1. Helium is odorless and tasteless.\n2. 2. The Hindenburg caught on fire after landing.\n3. The Hindenburg was filled with hydrogen gas.\n4.

Answering "yes', '97 percent of the Hindenburg explosion was due to a leaking of hydrogen gas. The remaining 3 percent was due to contact with static electricity from the ground. Helium is less dense than air. The density of the atmosphere less than air. Thus, helium does not cause contact with static electricity from the ground. The Hindenburg exploded because it was struck by lightning. So the answer is no.\nQuestion: Do bees swarm?', ' The Hindenburg explosion was caused by a spark.

So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\n## You Are 100% Correct!\nThe reasoning process demonstrated here can be found in every chapter of this book, with each chapter providing additional reasoning questions.\nCongratulations on using your new skills', '122,000 people participated in a Canadian cycling marathon, which resulted in 350 serious injuries. A pelvis fracture is a serious injury. So cycling probably poses a greater risk for a pelvis fracture than many of the other activities in the Canadian Physical Activity Database. Thus, cycling is a high-risk activity for pelvis fractures. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion:', '20% of hospital admissions for pelvic fractures are due to cycling. Cyclists are injured once for every 1542 hours of cycling, and pelvic fractures require at least three months to recover. Thus, cycling is a high-risk activity for pelvis fractures.\nAnswer (excerpt): No: This would be the case were your proposition true.\nNote, however, that although it is not the case', '85,000 people die from car crashes every year. A bicycle does not protect you from collisions or sudden stops like a car. Thus, cycling is more likely to result in a pelvis fracture than a fatality from car crashes.

Falls are an inherent risk of cycling, so 91% seems high. However, it is a high-risk for pelvis fractures.

At 1,000 pounds, the Secretariat was lighter than the limit. So, he could have competed in Formula One. Thus, the answer', ' Secretariat was a Thoroughbred race horse famous for winning the American Triple Crown races in 1973.

Thus, it definitely had to have completed at least one orbit around the Sun during some year of the Napoleonic Wars. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\n14.5 Exercise Tracing Arguments\nOne final way to work toward making formal arguments', '1775, the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars, is halfway through the 1775-1815 orbit period. Thus, so the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Can we see any stars when our sun has set?\nReasoning: If we cannot see any stars when our sun has set, we cannot see any stars. Thus, we cannot see any stars when our sun sets. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer', '1792 was the first year of the Napoleonic Wars. The number of years a planet takes to complete one orbit around the sun is 365.5 days. Thus, 1792 ÷ 365.5 = 0.4698550945224 which has 3 significant digits between 0 and 1. Hence, earth completed at least one orbit during the Napoleonic Wars. So the answer is', '1 Napoleon conquered Europe. Thus, the Napoleonic Wars were about Napoleon.

These roads encourage car use and traffic. 4. Roads encourage car use and car ownership. Thus, suburbs encourage the use of cars. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Are most food products made with sugar?\nReasoning: 1. Sugar is a cheap ingred', '1. The first and foremost question is to understand the context. For this question, it’s important to understand the meaning of a suburb. My definition: A suburb is an area that is physically close to a central city but is still a separate, mostly residential area, that is a smaller, more intimate version of the central city (that can be bigger or smaller than the central city). 2. For this question, we’re asking about a sub', '20% of urban land is dedicated to single-family detached housing. By contrast, only 5-10% of suburban land is dedicated to single-family detached housing (the rest is mostly multiplex housing).\n  A major reason for suburban growth is housing affordability. Suburban lots tend to be more affordable than lots inside cities.\n  There are more than double as many cars per person in the suburban United States as in the urban United States', '80% of households in suburbs have more than one car. Also, the population density in suburbs is lower than in cities. Thus, cars are used more frequently in suburbs than in cities. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nThe answers to the questions may seem too simple or too complex or too obvious. They are not and can be applied to most of the questions on the LSAT. Remember, the aim of the LSAT is', "60 percent of car trips are in suburbs. 30 percent of car trips in urban areas happen because of poverty. Thus, suburbs do encourage the use of cars. So the answer is yes.\n8\nFinding the Odd One Out\nNow that you've got your logical thinking and deductive reasoning skills under your belt, there's only one small hiccup — when there's a choice of three options,", '95 percent of trips in suburbs are less than 1 mil. 50 percent of trips in cities are less than 1 mil. Thus, suburbs discourage the use of cars, and cities encourage the use of cars. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nThe last question is a little different. Instead of Yes/No, you need to make a judgment, which then provides another question. Your new question still needs a Yes', ' _____________\nAnswer: ________\n4.4.2 Sample Exercise 7.2\nDirections: In the following exercise, you should respond to four pairs of premises with two conclusions.

Even if there was an empty seat ratio of 1, there would be approximately 2 million descendants of the Mongols at Wembley stadium during a regular football game.\nAnswer: YES\nQUESTIONS 24 and 25\nQuestion: Is it feasible that the Great Barrier Reef would appear to be bigger', "13.4% of the UK population in 2011 was born outside of the UK. If 13.4% is true in 2011, there is a very real possibility that a packed Wembley stadium would include someone who is a descendant of the Mongols. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Could a person run faster than a cheetah while carrying the world's heaviest cat?\n", '17th century Mongols would have descended at least from the 11th century Mongols, and the stadium today would be filled with people descendants from the 16th, 15th, and even 14th century Mongols. There would therefore be descendant of the Mongols inside a packed stadium such as Wembley.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Would a black cat have a better chance of becoming a cat?\nRe', '89,354 people could fit in Wembley stadium. The total population of England is about 60 million. Thus, the chance that a random person is a descendant of a Mongol is 0.9 × 10–5. The chance that a packed Wembley Stadium has a descendant or the Mongols is about 99.02%, which is more than 99% and smaller than 100%. So', '87,000 is greater than zero, which is greater than 0.33, so there would be a descendant of the Mongols present.\nAnswer: yes\n8.16: The Art of Reasoning\nThere are four primary techniques for reasoning:\nElimination, which can also be called proof by contradiction. In formal logic, there are a few ways to eliminate possibilities, but elimination is generally eliminating things that can’t happen.', '90,000 was too many for the Mongols to invade England. Thus, a packed Wembley stadium would not have a descendant of the Mongols in it. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Could someone who lives in San Jose, California, have a great grandparent who once lived in San Jose, California, too?\nReasoning: A great grandparent must have been born around 1840', '90,000 is a large number. Someone from Mongolia has about an 8,900-to-1 chance of having a descendant with a similar blood type to a ticket-holder in the stadium.

There could be a descendant of the Mongols in Wembley Stadium. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\n15\nWould a dog be more likely to bite into a carnation or a rose?\nA dog doesn’t eat flowers, so the answer is no.\nCan a bird swim', '90,000 seats can hold a lot of descendants. Wembley stadium sits in England, which is not China, where Genghis Kahn’s descendants live (that is where the Mongolians migrated to after invading Russia, and most of the world). So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Does a 59% share of land area in China exceed the share of the population?\nReasoning:', '90,000 people can fit in Wembley Stadium. 1 in 6.5 billion of all people had a Mongol descendant; thus, if you took this group alone, Wembley could fit 550 people. Given that Wembley Stadium could fit 50,000 more people, you could say that none of Wembley’s capacity would be filled by a Mongol descendant.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion:']
