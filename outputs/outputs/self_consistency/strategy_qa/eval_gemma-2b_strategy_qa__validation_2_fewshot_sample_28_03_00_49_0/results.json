So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Would a pear sink in water?\nReasoning: The density of a pear is about 0.6 g/cm3, which is less than water. Objects less dense than water float. Thus, a pear would float. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Could a llama birth twice during War in Vietnam (1945-46)?\nReasoning: The War in Vietnam was 6 months. The gestation period for a llama is 11 months, which is more than 6 months. Thus, a llama could not give birth twice during the War in Vietnam. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Is it common to see frost during some college commencements?\nReasoning: College commencement ceremonies can happen in December, May, and June. December is in the winter, so there can be frost. Thus, there could be frost at some commencements.

Since neutrons and protons both have an atomic number of 1, we can conclude that the atomic number of the element equal to the number of neutrons in the element is 7. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Could you do anything with your tongue inside?\nReasoning: There are 20 bones in the upper and lower jaws. Each jaw can twist, turn, and wiggle.
