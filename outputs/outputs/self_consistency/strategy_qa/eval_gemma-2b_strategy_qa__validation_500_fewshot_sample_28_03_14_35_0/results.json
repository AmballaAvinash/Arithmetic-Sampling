        "1969 was the year that Van Morrison released \"Brown Eyed Girl\". \"Brown Eyed Girl\" is a rock song. Rock is a genre of music that is popular with men. Thus, the title of \"Brown Eyed Girl\" applies to a minority of women worldwide. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\n",
        "10% of women worldwide have an average title for their first single. However, 10% is the same as 0.1. 0.1 x 10,000,000 is 100,000. 100,000 is not the same as 500,000. Therefore, at least 500,000 women worldwide have an average title for their first single",

        "2,221 songs have been played on the radio more than 500 times since 1967. 2,221/2,221 = 1. This means that there is only a 1 in 2,221 chance that a random song has been played more than 500 times since 1967.
