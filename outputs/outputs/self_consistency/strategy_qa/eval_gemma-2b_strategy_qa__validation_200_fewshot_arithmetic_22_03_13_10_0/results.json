The university is committed to \u201cdeveloping innovative research solutions to a wide range of health problems through partnerships with academic medical centers, clinicians, health agencies and communities.\u201d 3. Since 1870, these principles have guided them in their interactions with the community, and they will continue to do so. Thus, the principles of respect for persons and beneficence that Johns Hopkins University has had since 1870 have guided them to treat their subjects with respect and with beneficial health care for them. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes",

        "1962: Dr. Stanley Schneider was fired for unethical behavior after a Johns Hopkins investigation, leading to the 1964 lawsuit in which they won. Since then, Hopkins has always been required to conduct research in ways that are ethical to subjects. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes",
        "1978 is the beginning of Johns Hopkins University\u2019s involvement in the Tuskegee Institute study. Tuskegee University was a facility that had been used to treat African Americans with syphilis. Over 70% of the African-Americans were infected with the disease. The study was stopped by the US government in 1972 because of questions over informed consent and the quality of the study design. Since 1972, Johns Hopkins\u2019s involvement in research has been questioned. There also has been an ongoing investigation since 1990 as to who was responsible for the Tuskegee study and whether they knew of its unethical aspects when they ordered it conducted. Some of the people involved in the study have been indicted and convicted as a result of the investigation. So, we do not know the answers to this question. We do know that the Tuskegee study was unethical and Johns Hopkins was involved. Thus, the answer is No.\n\nQuestion: Has"

        "<strong>Answer</strong>: Yes, black-tailed jackrabbits do not fear European wildcats. Some of the jackrabbits are killed by European wildcats, but black-tailed jackrabbits are not as preyed on by European wildcats as other jackrabbits because black-tailed jackrabbits are smaller than coyotes, which are their closest predators (and preyed on by black-tailed jackrabbits). Also jackrabbits have a bad smell, which makes many predators avoid them (but not the European wildcat) (sources). Therefore, the European wildcats fear the black-tailed jackrabbits.\nThe following activities should be completed after reading the module introduction.\nRead the lesson introduction.\nWork on the following activities on your own or with a partner.\nReview the lesson objectives.\nIf a word in the lesson is not clear or unfamiliar to you, study the lesson vocabulary.\nStudy the lesson key terms or concepts"

Therefore, it seems unlikely that a person could eat 12lbs turkey in one hour. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\n\n<strong>What do I think about this type of problem?\n</strong>At first glance, it seems fairly straightforward, but upon closer inspection certain assumptions may be needed. For example, there is the assumption that a food is <strong>not</strong> already eaten. That is, all the food provided by the roast bird is available for us to use.

So the answer is yes (24.6 lbs) and an explanation is that if a person can eat 454 grams per minute (1 pound=454 grams), then they could eat an entire 12-lb roast turkey in an hour which is 12,246.3 grams. 12,246.3 grams divided by 6",

        "<i>To answer this question, please review:\nThe density of an object can be used to determine its mass. The higher a substance`s density, the heavier it is; the lower the density, the thinner it is.\nDensity is dependent on mass per unit volume, which means the mass per unit volume (i.e. density) does not change when the mass of an object changes, but rather the volume (size) of an object affects its density.\nDensity = mass per unit volume\nM = mass and V = volume.\nThus, when mass remains the same, the volume determines density; the higher the volume, the lower the density.\nIf density is lower and volume is lower, the object `s mass per unit volume is lower, and the density would be lower.\nWhen a subject is denser, it tends to sink while subject that sink is not as dense tends to float.</i>\n\n\n<b>What is an object density formula?</b>\n\nThe density",

So COVID-19 spread to maritime pilots, but not universally. The 1,175,949 cases include asymptomatic and mild illness cases. If you did your research, you would have found that 129,433 of the cases are currently active. Therefore, 85.76% of the cases were mild. Thus, maritime pilots may be at a higher risk of getting COVID-19. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes",

This one case was about 47 days before the other 63,333 cases. About 50% of the cases have been reported about 3 months after the infected person first developed symptoms. If the infected person contracted COVID-19 in July, it could take them at least 3 to 4 months to develop symptoms.

        "\nAnswer: \nQuestion 5: A small boy with a 60 kg body mass (assume a typical boy) falls from a height of 3 m off a playground slide onto a sand pile he is standing on. The boy stands up after falling off the slide, bounces once off the sand pile, stands up and walks 3 m to the base of the slide and falls off a second time. This repeated process of bouncing down and walking off takes 0.3 seconds. The boy is observed to be elastically compressed at the bottom of the slide and rebounds to the top in 2.47 seconds. Determine the force of the slide on the boy?\nReasoning: \nAnswer: (1.99 N)\nExplanation: \n(Note: There will be two parts to this problem which have 90,000 points.)",
        "800,000-barrels of gunpowder in storage can result in a 100x detonation, which is a strong shock wave. Shock waves travel at speeds that can produce supersonic effects. Thus, an explosion at a gunpowder storage facility can result in a supersonic shock wave. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes",
        "1:1,000 kilograms of TNT is equivalent in energy to about 0.5 kilograms of explosive material. If a 2.4-5 kilogram explosive charge explodes, it generates a pressure increase of 235,000 pascals. Air will expand at this pressure. When the pressure increases rapidly, the speed of sound may occur and form a shock wave. Air will generate a shock wave on impact, which causes damage. Thus, an explosion at a gunpowder storage facility could result in a supersonic shock wave. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Is it more costly to go to the doctor?\nReasoning: The average cost for an office visit is about $193. For a hospital stay, the average cost is about $358. An overnight stay usually costs about $2000. Thus, an overnight stay is more costly to a patient than an office visit. So the answer is yes."

        "1929 was three years before the Wall Street Crash which was in 1932. Only five of 800 robotics companies that existed in 1937 survived the Wall Street Crash in 1932. The majority of robotics companies that had survived the Wall Street Crash did so between 1936 and 1937. Therefore, the Wall Street Crash did not hurt the stocks for the majority of the robotics companies. Thus, robots did not go away due to the Wall Street Crash. Answer the same way.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Can you use a car engine as a microwave?\nReasoning: Yes, in 2012 a man was able to do just that. He used a vehicle\u2019s engine as a microwave to cook food. He also used a car starter to power on the engine. This was achieved by using a laptop and a 3-way switch as the control device. For reasons",

However, credit cards often take a very long time to work off debt. They give the option of not paying off the purchase right away, but most people do not know how much the full cost of any product is just from the price on the label.

        "<em>The answer to this is no. A great many people believed that the Wall Street Crash was caused by the Federal Reserve System\u2019s efforts to control the inflation of the 1920s. The Federal Reserve System, though, didn\u2019t control inflation. In fact, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had actually pushed the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy through legislation in 1930 \u2013 just as the Great Depression was beginning. And so, people looked to the government to save them in their investment and they, therefore, blamed the Federal Reserve for the stock market slump. However, as we learned throughout this course, it was actually the stock market drop that led the American people to demand government assistance. If the Federal Reserve could have stopped the drop in stocks, then the government might have been able to restore investors\u2019 confidence in stock market\u2019s future. In all, though, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 contributed to the start of the Great Depression. While many",
        "27% of Wall Street stockbrokers reported that the crash had little or no impact on their investment decisions. However, in response to the crash, investors withdrew $60 billion from companies. Thus, there will have been more than 25,000 robo-stock brokers, which means that a significant majority of robo-stock brokers are likely to have reported that the crash had little or no impact on their investment decisions. So the answer is yes.",

So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: If A B=1, will A=2B?\nReasoning: A and B are variables. Since they are not equal, the equation is not true. Also, by a law of logic, if A=B, then A can't actually equal 2B because then the equation will be true, and we are looking for the opposite of truth. Thus, the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Could you run 5 miles in less than 30 minutes?\nReasoning: All variables above can be changed on the following equations to yield true or false results.

Blood spatter pattern is typically blood that has been splattered from a single time, while a painting is made from multiple splatters that are usually at different locations. 3) Jackson Pollock paintings typically include all sorts of shapes, while blood spatter pattern typically only includes shapes of one variety (for instance, a spatter that looks like a person's profile is typically the same shape, while a spatter that looks like a door handle is typically the same shape).

        "1967 was after the year of 1967 to find Arnold Schwarzenegger in his first major film role. 1967 was also the year that the red fox was introduced in Star Trek. Schwarzenegger was not in the first film, but he was the actor who played the Terminator, and his presence in Star Trek would have required some lifting. As Arnold Schwarzenegger was not as strong in 1967 as he was in 1968 or later, Arnold Schwarzenegger would probably have a pretty hard time picking up a red fox. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes",
        "1967 is before the time that Arnie was born; therefore, he would not have picked up a red fox.\nAnswer: yes",
        "1967 is 97 years before Arnold Schwarzenegger was born. The maximum lifespan for male red foxes is 8-10 years. Thus, Arnold Schwarzenegger could have picked up a red fox. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes",
        "1967 is about the same year as the beginning of the Cuban Missile Crisis. It could be an interesting time to try such a demonstration. Thus, Arnold Schwarzenegger would probably find the red fox in 1967. So the answer is yes.\n\n<h3>Answers to Practice Problems</h3>",
        "1.) Arnold Schwarzenegger was a bodybuilder in 1967. At that time, bodybuilders didn't have the same strength as weightlifters. So using his bodybuilder strength, Arnold would not have picked up a red fox. 2.) If he picked up a red fox, his muscles would have been strained. If he strained his muscles, his body would not have worked well as an engine for the rest of his life. 3.) Therefore, Arnold Schwarzenegger would have a hard time picking up a fox in 1967. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Should I be concerned about the size of my penis, and why?\nReasoning: A doctor once told me that my penis needed some more \"oomph\" to have sex. That's because my penis size is 3.5cm x 3.1cm. My friend, on the other hand, has a 9.6cm x",
        "2 years before Arnold Schwarzenegger was born, in 1965, the average male height was 59.2 inches, which is 4 inches shorter than the average height of a fox. Thus, Arnold Schwarzenegger would have a hard time picking up a red fox in 1967. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: yes",
        "1967 should have been at the beginning of the Stone Age, so there were no red foxes. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no",
        "1967 was August, and the season for red foxes is March - October. 1967 was also the year Schwarzenegger's father, Alberto, was born in Austria. This means Schwarzenegger would not have been born in time for his father to teach him how to hunt fox. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: No\nQuestion: Should a farmer choose to keep a tiger as a pet in 2006?\nReasoning: 2006 is March, which is the month tigers are pregnant. Tigers are capable of conceiving several times within the same pregnancy. So keeping a tiger as a pet in 2006 probably wouldn't work. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: No",
        "1967 was the year that Arnold Schwarzenegger was born. Red foxes can jump almost 3 meters and have mass of about 15 kg. In 1967, Arnold Schwarzenegger was 0 m, so he would have a hard time picking up a red fox in 1967. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Will President John F Kennedy be killed in 1963?\nReasoning: JFK was born in 1946. This means he was about 17 years old when John F Kennedy was elected president in 1960. While an 18 year old is more than old enough to drive a car, the average age at which one becomes a licensed driver in Texas is about 16.7 years old (with a wide variation of approximately 3.0 years). As such, John F Kennedy would not have been old enough to drive a car when he was elected",
