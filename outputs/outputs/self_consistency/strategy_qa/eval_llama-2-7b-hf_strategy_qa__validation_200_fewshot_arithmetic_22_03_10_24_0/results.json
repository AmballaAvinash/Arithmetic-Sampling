        "2013 is a common year. Common years have 642 days (365.25 x 2013). Rincewind\u2019s first visit to Discworld is in The Color of Magic (The Rincewind Adventures, Discworld, book 1). In part 2 of the book, Rincewind and others get on a boat to travel up the Disc. This journey takes several days. On day 87 of the trip, Discworld is hit by an atomic bomb. The party gets blown off into a different dimension. This chapter ends at page 71 of the book. Thus, Rincewind does not fight Gandalf. The book ends with an unused title page image.

If you have any doubts, you can research which breeds of dogs are the most commonly-seen dogs, and how they fair in competitions. I\u2019m almost sure that you can find statistics that show dogs are not a huge competition compared to some other animals. A duck may win best actor sometimes"

        " King of Portuguese people in 1515 was Affonso I. The father of King Affonso I was John II. John II was the son of Pedro I. Pedro I was the son of Ferdinand II, who was related to some Tudors, but not closely. Thus, the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Is a dung beetle a bird?\nReasoning: A dung beetle has many traits in common with other insects. It is a flying insect, has segmented body parts, and has appendages for locomotion. Birds do not have many of these traits. They fly, but their wings are covered in feathers, not segmented, and are not for locomotion. They have segmented body parts, but the segments are not all fused. The appendages for locomotion are called 'tails', which a dung beetle does not have. Thus",
        "1515 was 150 years before 1665, which was 450 years before 2015. So there are 450 years in 1515. The Tudors were British people who ruled England between 1485 and 1603. There are 114 years in 1603. There would be 170 years in 1485; thus, there would be 220 years in 1485. So 1515 could be 100 years after 1485, which could be 50 years before 1665. So 1515 could be within 450 years of 1665, which could be within the 50 years between 1485 and 1603. So there is a slight chance that the",
        "1515 was five years after the end of the War of the English Succession. Tudors are people who fought against the House of Lancaster during the War of the English Succession. Tudors are not present in 1515. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Can crayfish be found in every U.S. state?\nReasoning: There are 49 U.S. states. 49\u20131 = 48 remaining states. We know 13 of those states are in the Northeast. We know that no crayfish are found on the islands of the Pacific Ocean. Thus, it is possible to find crayfish in every U.S. state but Hawaii and Alaska. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Can a penguin be found on the mainland of China?\nReasoning: We know"

The average adult human eats approximately 4164 calories/day. 4164 calories / 75 lb person = 56 calories/lb person. 56 \u00d7 (12 \u00f7 75) = 2 calories/min. Eating 12-lb turkey at an average rate of 2 cal/min = approx one hour. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Can a man take off his pants in the ocean after 12 minutes?\nReasoning: A man\u2019s body temperature is 98.6\u00baF. Water\u2019s temperature is approximately 50\u00baF (39\u00baF -79\u00baF). Thus, the man\u2019s body will be 48.6\u00baF colder than the water. Therefore, it will take approximately ",
        "\n**YES\u2014** The answer is yes. Why? Because in 2012, a New Jersey man ate an 18-lb turkey by himself in 41 minutes, and the bird had skin and bones. He ate half a pound of stuffing and a 3-1b side of mashed potatoes and ate in total 12,000 calories in one sitting. \n**NO\u2014** However, the answer is no. This is because if a human eats 12-lb turkey whole in an hour, he/she could choke to death/become obese/go into a food coma/etc. Thus, the answer is no. This example is adapted from the New York Daily News article \"Turkey tamer: New Jersey man eats 18-pound bird before Thanksgiving.\"\nAs demonstrated in the previous examples, this is",

They need to learn the logical structure for arguments and the structure for the fallacies of argumentation. The logic challenge will be to develop more complex arguments. The fallacy-response challenge will be to notice more arguments with fallacies.\nFor developing more complex arguments, this means they have to add more premises and conclusions and make them more abstract.

Let us use this type of questioning as a means of understanding.\n###### The Socratic Method\nSome of you may have seen interviews where someone asks a difficult question, which the person being interviewed doesn't seem to answer. Later, they either answer the question or explain the reasons they didn't answer the question. The idea of interviewing is to bring out important information, and the Socratic method is a way of doing that. We use the Socratic method to get to the truth and understand the world beyond a simple yes or no. It is used to challenge assumptions, which are made when someone doesn",
        "3/4 of picking strawberries is standing up straight and swinging a pick; whereas, 1/4 of it is squatting. Picking strawberries would hurt someone with back pain.

For example, imagine someone is looking for houses for rent, and they stumble on a duplex that is $2000 per month. Their first logical assumption is that since it is duplex they can rent it for $1,500 per month, and they will have $500 for their own use.

        "1. Mile is not that much. 2. Olympians are not ordinary people. 3. Runners can have super muscles and tendons. Thus, an Olympian could run a mile and then run another mile. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Could the Boston Red Sox win the world series four times during the decade of the 2000s?\nReasoning: 1. At least two teams need to go to the World Series for the Boston Red Sox to win the World Series. 2. At least one team needs to lose for the Boston Red Sox to win the World Series. Thus, at least three teams need to go to the World Series for the Boston Red Sox to win the World Series. Thus, the Boston Red Sox could win the World Series four times during the decade of the 2000s. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer",
        "0.2 km \u00d7 0.2 km is equal to 1/4 km (0.2 km for 0.2 km) and 1/4 km \u00d7 1/4 km is equal to 1 km. Thus, there are 4 0.2-kilometer distances, so 4 0.2 km. Thus, an Olympic athlete can run 4 0.2 km to run a mile (0.2 \u00d7 6). Thus, an Olympic athlete ________ miles can run 0.2 kilometers. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: can run only\nYou can also get creative with questions:\nQuestion: Why could the United States win the Battle of Bull Run?\nReasoning: The United States won the Battle of Bull Run. Bull run could refer to a running person. Thus, the United States might have won the Battle of Bull Run because it had people who were better",
        "4-minute miles are possible. Thus, an Olympic athlete could complete a mile in less than 4 minutes and be tired out. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nCritique the Reasoning\nThe first four of these six questions present situations where reasoning is simple enough. Only the last two questions are somewhat challenging.\nThe first three questions ask whether some specific event occurred or was possible. The fourth question, the yes question, is trickier because it asks whether something is \"common.\" Since we are not in the habit of surveying college graduates to see who attended a commencement in the snow, it is hard for us to imagine whether or not such an event takes place. For example, do you know anyone graduating in the summer who had to cross a stage inside a college building while wearing a robe and some mortarboard? Most graduates who attend commencements have either been on a college campus before or",
        "1984 was the year the US lost its Olympics medals and many thought it was because of \"doping\" by the Russians. It was also said that the US sprinters did not run a whole mile in Olympic trials as they would do if they were just running in high school. Thus, Olympic athletes are not tired at the end of a mile. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Would an elephant be small in a zoo?\nReasoning: A zoo is not a place in which animals can be free. Therefore, an elephant at a zoo would be small. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Would a cow be large at a zoo?\nReasoning: Zoo animals could range in size. However, zoo animals need to eat. Therefore, cows could likely be large at a zoo. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes"

So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nYou might object: \"But, it will take too long.\" To that, I point out that so far you have taken about 10 minutes to complete this one-page exercise, in addition to having answered 40 other questions in 20 previous chapters.\nIn this chapter, you are practicing your _analytic reasoning_ skills under real-life conditions. Analytic reasoning is not just doing math in your head or just learning new math. It is also learning to answer simple yet _complex_ questions analytically, as you saw above.\nFurthermore, this chapter is part of your preparation for the analytic tests such as the GMAT and LSAT. As you will soon see, your performance on these types of tests is",
        " It was determined by the NTSB that there was a failure of the outer coating of the hydrogen (which is what caused the inflammable gas to leak). The NTSB's conclusions were based on the assumption that the Hindenburg and/or the hydrogen contained helium. If helium were to have been the cause, then the failure would have been based on helium, not hydrogen. The determination was therefore incorrect.\nAnswer: no\n34. You recently read about an animal species that is currently listed as endangered. It may be possible that the animal is extinct, but in order to find out you have to travel for 5 years in some strange way of your choosing. How do you decide if it would be worth it to do so?\nReasoning and Answer: You would go to a remote part of the world the animal was known to have lived in during the 5 years you were traveling",
        " The Hindenburg explosion happened on May 6, 1937. Helium did _not_ become available for the helium-filled Hindenburg until sometime during the late 1920s. Helium did _not_ fill the Hindenburg as it flew over Germany in 1937, but the Hindenburg did _not_ explode for 20 years thereafter in 1957 and 1962. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\n10.4\nLogic\nIn this section, students will learn fundamental principles of logic and develop the ability to recognize deductive arguments and determine whether they are valid.\nFinding Inference\nIn _Introduction to Geometry_ , Euclid writes:\n_Every straight line lies either on one side or other the straight line it cuts_ or makes a pair of angles which are right with it.",
        "4 weeks prior to the Hindenburg explosion, 65% of the public surveyed blamed its explosion to helium, while 12% of the public surveyed believed its explosion to be due to hydrogen. Hydrogen is less dense than air and thus lighter than air. Hydrogen is 7.5% of air. Thus, hydrogen could have been a contributing factor to the explosion.\nAnswer: No.\nSuggestions for Answering Questions\n**Before you answer questions or present work,** have the following conversation with your partner.\n**Q1** : Can you answer a problem with Yes or No?\n**A1** : Yes. (Yes.)\n**Q1** : I'm not interested in whether or not you _can_ answer a problem with Yes or No, but in whether or not you _will_ take any work that's provided to you. ("

But reasoning is not just something that we human do \u2014 it is also something that we do to understand the actions and statements of other creatures or things! There are many contexts in which we use reasoning without even realizing it! In this section we will explore these contexts under the broader category of inference, the logical system used to make such inferences. We will also explore another type of reasoning which also plays a significant role in human thinking and activity, but which is less well-known than deduction or induction.\n6.4",

Therefore, March began on the same day of the week as February in 2012.\nAnswer: yes\n# STAGE 4: CHALLENGE THE ASSUMPTION\nAs you work through the questions, you gradually become aware of what is actually hidden in your premise. You can become aware of this in different ways. Often it happens quickly and you are able to see both where the hidden assumption is and the answer. But often you find the assumption too early to see the answer and may have to repeat the process a number of times before it begins to reveal itself. It helps if you allow enough time. The first thing to do is to put down your ideas on paper, even though it feels as if you are simply repeating what you know.\n",

To do so, we need to make an assertion about a given thing, and reason through each premise, asking and answering these questions along the way: What are the facts? What is the evidence? What is the conclusion? We have three separate questions to answer for each premise: What is true? What is false? What is indeterminate? When we apply the rules of logic, we can discover new information, and make more informed decisions.\nThis series is the first of many that will explore the connections between problem solving and how we teach and learn science, technology engineering, and mathematics. We hope it serves as an illustration of the interplay of evidence, reasoning, and conclusion to guide our students to their own conclusions.\nFor the first example, in addition to the rules of logic,",

        "1800 is a date, but Britain did not exist in 1800. The United Kingdom was, and is, a political system. Not a country or a country\u2019s name. Therefore, an Olympic medal won by a country that wasn\u2019t a country is impossible. England isn\u2019t that country. So the answer is no.\nQuestion: Can you buy an espresso in a convenience store?\nReasoning: Convenience stores sell convenience foods. Convenience foods include microwave dinners (frozen dinners), ice cream, cookies, etc. Not beverages like coffee. Since espressos must be consumed immediately after being prepared, they aren\u2019t considered convenience foods. So the answer is no.\nQuestion: Everyone in your study has the same birthday?\nReasoning: If there were 42 people in the study, at least one would have a birth",

So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Are tattoos common in Hollywood?\nReasoning: Many Hollywood stars have tattoos. But, even though they are popular and common in Hollywood they are not everywhere else. Thus, tattoos are uncommon in Hollywood. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Does California have an economy larger than the United Kingdom?\nReasoning: In 2014, the total economy of the United Kingdom was about $4 trillion per year. This is less than $2 trillion per year, which is estimated to be the annual income of the state of California. Therefore, the state of California has an economy larger than the United Kingdom. So the answer is yes.",
        "1800 was not an Olympic year. England was not a country in 1800. The United Kingdom, which is made up of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, did not compete in the Olympics until 1908. Thus, there can be no medals for England since England did not exist or compete. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Have all of President Trump's golf courses won an award on \"Golfweek Top 100 Courses for 2017?\"\nReasoning: President Trump does not have any golf courses. So they would not win any awards on \"Golfweek Top 100 Courses.\" Thus, the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Can an adult have a full and comprehensive education in five years?\nReasoning: Each degree you seek will take at least five years. Each minor can take",

Therefore, women will have more than men.

A bad inference is not the same as a false inference; an inference can be valid, but the conclusion may be false.

So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Could a high school student get to work before his/her boss?\nReasoning: A student can be in the same city as his or her boss. So, if the boss works close to the student\u2019s house, the student can",
        "22 years is almost certainly more than 1 (the amount of years that the Head Coach at NCSU has been there).

The U.S. is among the top 10 countries for the percentage of population with a Bachelor\u2019s degree. The U.S. is in the top 10 countries for the percentage of population with a Master\u2019s degree, and the U.S. is in the top 10 countries for the percentage of population with a Doctorate degree",
        "75 percent of high school head coaches earned less than $5,000 per year, while our sample size of NCSU\u2019s football is the highest wage in the sample. Thus, the proportion of high school head coaches who earn less than NC State\u2019s Head Coach is more than 75%. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes (yes)\nQuestion: Would a car\u2019s engine stall if it were submerged in water?\nReasoning: The engine is a major component of a car. Water is less dense than air and therefore would float an engine. As a result, an engine stalls in a car submerged in water. As a result, the answer is yes.\nQuestion: Is a duck-billed platypus a reptile?\nReasoning: Reptiles have scales, and a duck-billed platypus does not. Thus",

(Giraffes are the world's tallest animals.) The coconut palm measures 20 to 30 meters (60 to 100 feet) high. There is more than one coconut palm (the tallest tree in the world) in the world.

Thus the hypothetical Richard Dawkins' response to an hypothetical Last Rites would be unknown. Some people accept the Last Rites and some people don't.

Thus, Americans could save up to $1000 in a year watching High School Musical if they watch it for 7 hours a day. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Could the number",
        "1) Dawkins is a well-known atheist. 2) As an atheist, he likely believes that human rituals (such as the Last Rites) are superfluous and may even impede recovery from illness. 3) This belief leads him to expect that the Last Rites will not be of help or benefit to him in any way. Thus, he would decline the Last Rites. So the answer is Yes.\nQuestion: Do rabbits have the ability to see the colors red and orange?\nReasoning: Rabbits have been known to see ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light has a wavelength of 400\u2013450 nm, at which point it overlaps with the red and orange colors that we can see. Thus, there is some overlap and confusion and they may be able to see reds and oranges. So the answer is Yes."

        "2/4 waltz tempo is slow and steady, while slam dances (such as \u201crock and roll\u201d, \u201cbreakdance\u201d, and \u201cgangsta rap\u201d) involve a quick and sometimes jerky beat. Therefore, the tempo of a 2/4 waltz and slam dance is different with the former more consistent. Thus, the answer to this question is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: 12-13 times = 3?\nReasoning: 12 times is the same as 12, while 13 times is the same as 13.

Therefore, the answer is no.\nQuestion: Can a person eat 67 cookies in a minute?\nReasoning: Eating is a physical activity. Speed is a physical quantity that is dimensionless, not measured in units like mass and volume since it does not have a dimension. Mass and volume are measures of how much stuff you hold. 17 is not a whole number. Therefore, eating is not a physical activity.
