      "prompt": "Question: Do hamsters provide food for any animals?\nReasoning: Hamsters are prey animals. Prey are food for predators. Thus, hamsters provide food for some animals. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Would a pear sink in water?\nReasoning: The density of a pear is about 0.6 g/cm3, which is less than water. Objects less dense than water float. Thus, a pear would float. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Could a llama birth twice during War in Vietnam (1945-46)?\nReasoning: The War in Vietnam was 6 months. The gestation period for a llama is 11 months, which is more than 6 months. Thus, a llama could not give birth twice during the War in Vietnam. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Is it common to see frost during some college commencements?\nReasoning: College commencement ceremonies can happen in December, May, and June. December is in the winter, so there can be frost. Thus, there could be frost at some commencements. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Hydrogen\u2019s atomic number squared exceeds number of Spice Girls?\nReasoning: Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1. 1 squared is 1. There are 5 Spice Girls. Thus, Hydrogen\u2019s atomic number squared is less than 5.
