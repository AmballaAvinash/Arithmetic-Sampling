Thus, Tony Stark died in <em>Avengers: Infinity War.</em>\nThus, the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Does Chris Evans survive the Avengers: Endgame?\nReasoning: <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> (2019) shows Thor giving Stark his Arc Reactor so that Stark can be saved. Stark can't be saved because it is Thor's world, and Stark is not Thor. So Tony Stark survived until the Infinity War ended.\nBased on \"time travel\" logic, Stark must have been alive when <em>Infinity War</em> ended before the Endgame. Thus, the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Does Will Smith win a Grammy?\nReasoning: Will Smith",

        "1. The Hindenburg was a German Zeppelin airship, and they use Helium for ballast. 2. On 6 May 1937, the Hindenburg caught fire while docking in Lakehurst, NJ. 3. The airship was overloaded with He, and the pressure was enough to explode. 4. At 8.72 lb/cu.ft., Helium's density is much lighter than the average air, and He gas makes up 1% of our atmosphere. 5. The airship would reach the top of the stratosphere, the upper-most layer of the atmosphere, at an altitude of 28,000 ft, while our lower-most layer of atmosphere contains 80% of the air. 6. Due to high temperatures in the Hindenburg\u2019s upper atmosphere, the pressure at 11,000 ft. was 2/3rds of the pressure at 2",
        "1) The Hindenburg contained a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is lighter than air. If the Hindenburg exploded because of an air pocket on its floor, the air pocket would push the Hindenburg upward. Thus, the explosion could have been caused by a mixture of air and hydrogen. 2) The Hindenburg was being tested for its airworthiness. Testing can also cause explosions. If the Hindenburg\u2019s interior contained an explosion source (a hydrogen or oxygen release switch, for example), the hydrogen or oxygen release could have triggered the explosion.\nAnswer: yes",
        "173 passengers and 14 crew members died when the Hindenburg ship caught fire and exploded. The Hindenburg ship used hydrogen air instead of standard petroleum gas. In 1991 a book was published on the Hindenburg disaster and cited \u201cHelium leaked into the hydrogen-oxygen mixture in the lower part of the fuselage due to the leakage from the valve-cap on the main hydrogen tank\u201d. Thus, the Hindenburg ship caused the explosion. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes",
        "2.00 moles of helium (He) equals 100.0 grams which is less than 704.02 grams of oxygen (O2) which is the heaviest of the 53 air molecules in the Hindenburg. The fuel tanks will contain enough fuel to propel the Hindenburg into the stratosphere for just a bit more than 50 miles into the stratosphere.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Are both water and gasoline flammable?\nReasoning: A combination of water and gasoline may produce an explosive mixture that can burn. They produce flammable gas, or volatile material, when mixed and may have enough energy built up to form a chain reaction and explode.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Are there seven stars named after famous people?\nReasoning: Seven celebrities\u2019 names of seven stars have been given to famous people in space (NASA). These names have been given to people who were there that helped make space travel and exploration possible",
        "74 passengers and crew perished during the crash of the Hindenburg in 1937 while attempting a transatlantic flight from Lakehurst, NJ to Europe. Helium was carried in the craft, so it is possible that the Hindenburg's crash had something to do with the presence of helium gas in the craft. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Could one person die during a fire at the Brooklyn Bridge?\nReasoning: The Brooklyn Bridge was built in 1883 and has 70 spans. 6 people have died during maintenance on the Brooklyn Bridge. Thus, it is possible that one person could die during maintenance. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Can a person be in a car accident and drive home?\nReasoning: A car accident can result in severe injury, and the person can be unconscious for many hours after the accident.

A calendar starts during the year. Therefore the Julian calendar was not used in North Africa. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\n(Questions 1, 7, 11, 13, and 15 have similar reasoning.)",
        "12 B.C. is 2,352 Julian (or B.C.E. calendar days) past 1 January 1 BC. In 1 A.D., 12 A.D. was 1,352 Julian days past 1 January 1 A.D. The Julian day counts backward from the current day to 1 January BC and forward from the current day to 1 January A.D., then add one to a B.C. number and subtract one from an A.D. number. Thus, Saint Augustine used the Julian calendar. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Can a fish be fed by ants?\nReasoning: Fish are mostly herbivore. Ants are mostly carnivore. Thus, ants can not feed fish. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no",
        "170 years before Julian calendar, a Greek named Callippus (270~230 BC) invented the 15,824-year Metonic cycle. A Metonic cycle is 235=114 years to the day of the year, 1461 to the week, and 396 to the lunar cycle. There are about 120 moons in a Metonic cycle. Each year lasts approximately 365.2429 days (about 365 2429/120). The Julian calendar fixed a lunar month of 29.530589 days, but Saint Augustine did not use the Julian calendar for some unknown reasons.

Thus, white light has light and heat energy. Also, the energy levels between the atoms within matter are quantized and energy is emitted when the matter (or atom) undergoes a change in energy. This quantized energy is the reason why visible light exists. 2. This evidence supports the hypothesis that white light is a single source of light not consisting of distinct colors.

        "1,001 Nights is a collection of Middle Eastern stories which is over 1,000 years older than the Canterbury Tales. 1,000 years is older than 1. Thus, The Canterbury Tales was probably written before One Thousand and One Nights. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Has the speed, force, or angle of a force impact on the distance an object travels?\nReasoning: A force causes an object to accelerate. All forces, except for weight, are directed. However, the acceleration of an object depends on both the force and the weight. So, the distance an object travels depends mainly on both the force and the weight. Thus, the distance an object travels does not depend primarily on the speed, force, or angle exerted on an object.

Thus, by the law of universal gravitation, there will be no gravity between your head and your foot. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no",
        "<em>The Canterbury Tales</em> was written about 250-350 years before <em>One Thousand and One Nights</em>. 250-350 is longer than one thousand. So, <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> was written before <em>One Thousand and One Nights</em>.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Is any college more dangerous than Harvard Business School?\nReasoning: Harvard Business School is only more dangerous than any college if the most dangerous college is Harvard or not. There are 62 colleges in the Princeton review. If each college is equally dangerous, then their average is 1. If there is the most dangerous one, then 63% would be the average, and the remainder 37% would be all the rest. 63% is 0.63. Thus, 0.63 * 62 = 39.78. 39.78>37. 3",

Mercantilism requires countries to control and restrict imports and exports so that a country gains control over the goods and services from other countries. The British exported goods to India. For every good that China exported to the British, the British would export them a better, more quality, or higher priced good than the goods they were sending to China.

You could eat 126 g/L. However, the reason you could eat 120 g/L is that you should be able to chew through 0.126 kg/L, which is what you just found (because 126 g/L = 120 kg/L).

There is also a rule in Latin language that all names must contain the endings \u201cus,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cus.\u201d The endings of the word Pavor are \u201cus,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cus.\u201d Thus, Pavor is similar to the name of Roman god Pavor. 2) Pavor has 9 letters, so it\u2019s not similar to 8 letters in the name of Moon. 3) As Pavor starts with \u201cP,\u201d it\u2019s not similar to Phobos that starts with \u201cF.\u201d 4) Pavor is an adjective. Thus, it\u2019s not the same as an adverb/adj-verb combination such as phoronous, which is a combination of \u201cphorus\u201d and \u201cnous.\u201d 5) Pavor is a Latin word. Hence, it\u2019",

        "1. Yes, because Ahura Mazda is one of the seven God fathers of the Zoroastrian religion. But he sits on a throne that is level with heaven, and Abaddon's dwelling is in hell which is beneath all. 2. No, God (Yahweh) tells Abraham that the earth is his and he gives authority to his seed. Thus, Abraham is a god and Yahweh (his God) is an angel. This means that he cannot be on a throne which is level with heaven since the throne in heaven rests upon the head of God. Thus, Abraham cannot sit on a throne which rests on the head of God. 3. Yes, because the throne on which God rests is still under heaven, and his throne is the only throne under heaven. Thus, there is no throne on which Yahweh could sit that would be higher than the throne on which God sits on. 4. No, because God (Yahweh) created all things, including the earth",

However, \u201cand his spirit shall rest in Abaddon\u201d adds that Ahura's spirit would be residing within Abaddon. The text then says, \u201cAnd his pact shall be with him,\u201d which simply means Ahura has decided to surrender to Abaddon, his spirit will reside within him, and the treaty between the two is decided.
