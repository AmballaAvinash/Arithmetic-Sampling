So, although proofreading Poe's works was not a financial undertaking, it was clearly a very successful endeavor that benefited Poe'",
        "16 of Poe's poems were published during his lifetime, and the remaining poems were published after his death. This means that proofreading Poe's poems was lucrative for a while. However, as his wealth dwindled, so did the demand for his poems. As a result, proofreading Poe's poems became less lucrative in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

        "20th century philosophers and critics have argued that the work of the artist Cezanne contains a moral dimension that transcends the purely aesthetic. His paintings are often seen as reflections of the artist's own personal life and experiences, and his use of symbolism and imagery has been interpreted as a critique of traditional morality. So, an ethics professor might find it difficult to teach a class on Cezanne without including some discussion of the ethical issues raised by his work. So the answer is no.\nAnswer:",
        "20th century philosophers, including Jean-Paul Sartre, argued that Cezanne's work was a form of existentialism. Sartre believed that existentialism is a philosophy that emphasizes the individual's freedom and responsibility to create meaning in a meaningless world. So, an ethics professor would not be able to teach a class on Cezanne because Cezanne's work is not a philosophical subject. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no",

        "5-fluorouracil, a medication used to treat depression, can interact with citrus fruits. Citrus fruits can cause serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. So, someone on antidepressants should be cautious of consuming citrus fruits. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes",
        "5-fluorinated citrus fruits, such as oranges and grapefruits, can worsen symptoms of depression in some people. Antidepressants can suppress the metabolism of 5-fluorinated citrus fruits, leading to increased levels of the toxic compound fluorosis. Therefore, people taking antidepressants should avoid consuming 5-fluorinated citrus fruits. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes",
        "5-7 types of antidepressants can cause allergic reactions to citrus fruits. These reactions can range from mild symptoms such as skin rashes and hives to more severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing and swelling of the face and tongue. So, the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes",
        "5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HTP) is a neurotransmitter that is involved in mood regulation. Citrus fruits can contain high levels of 5-HTP, which can interact with antidepressants and cause side effects such as anxiety, insomnia, and dizziness. So, while it is not necessary to avoid citrus fruits, individuals on antidepressants should be cautious when eating them. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes",
        "5-HT1 receptors are involved in regulating serotonin, a neurotransmitter that is affected by antidepressants. Citrus fruits contain limonene, a compound that can interfere with serotonin receptors. Consuming citrus fruits while taking antidepressants could potentially worsen serotonin syndrome, a condition that is characterized by symptoms such as agitation, anxiety, and insomnia. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes"
