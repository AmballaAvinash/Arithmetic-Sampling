So, it would be important to be cautious of citrus fruits for people on antidepressants. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes",
        "1. Antidepressants may cause increased serotonin levels, leading to serotonin poisoning. 2. Citrus fruits contain limonene, which can inhibit the function of monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme that breaks down serotonin. 3. Consuming citrus fruits while taking antidepressants can cause serotonin poisoning or MAO inhibition. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes",
        "5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HTP) is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in mood, appetite, and sleep. Antidepressants can affect the 5-HTP system, which could lead to side effects such as anxiety, insomnia, and irritability. Citrus fruits can contain high levels of serotonin, another neurotransmitter that can interact with 5-HTP. Consuming citrus fruits while taking antidepressants could potentially worsen symptoms. Therefore, someone on antidepressants should be cautious of consuming",
