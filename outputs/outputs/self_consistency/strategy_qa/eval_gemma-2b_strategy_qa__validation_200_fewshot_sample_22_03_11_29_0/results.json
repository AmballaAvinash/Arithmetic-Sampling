Since Gandalf could not be defeated, Gandalf hypothetically defeats Rincewind.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Could Frodo Baggins die during the Fellowship of the Ring quest?\nReasoning: Samwise Gamgee, a humble farmer, accompanies the hobbits during their journey to destroy the One Ring in Mordor. He is one of the most unlikely companions because his father thought he was crazy for helping Frodo Baggins, the last living heir of the noble house of Baggins. The story indicates that while hiking on the path of the Ring, Sam has great difficulty remaining with Frodo. Thus, Sam can probably die with Frodo during their quest.\nAnswer: yes",

The size difference would make the European wildcat the predator and black-tailed jack rabbits the prey, so black-tailed jackrabbits would not fear the European wildcat.</i> So no, black-tailed jackrabbits do not fear the European wildcat.\nThe key concept from the question stems is that the difference in size between a predator and prey species causes a predator to hunt and hunt only prey species smaller than the predator. A black-tailed jackrabbit would not make a good meal for a European wildcat, so black-tailed jackrabbits have no reason to fear European wildcats.\nAnother example:\nQuestion: Do black-tailed jackrabbits fear the European wildcat?\nReasoning:"

        "1. Not many places (funeral homes excepted) have birthday candles during a funeral; birthday presents are usually displayed instead, and not as a ritual. If it were to happen, it would be in small groups, not individually and certainly not in front of a large number of people.\n2. Even if it WERE allowed in some circumstance, there would be no cake and nobody would blow out any candles. Why? Because they\u2019d be too distraught to do anything for a while.\n3. It\u2019s hard to imagine someone NOT blowing out candles at a funeral. Yes, they can be extinguished and reused. But if someone can\u2019t wait (for example, when they just have to see the birthday girl again and get those special moments back in their life), then they would blow them out anyway.\nAnswer: no",
        "1500 year olds have no hands.\nAnswer: no",
        "1788 was the year the first birthday candles were advertised. Birthday candles used to be the same color as wax. By the 1800s candles were clear white. Also, it was a custom to blow out the candles before the meal. Blowouts are a custom for the dead, not the living. As such, candles cannot be blown out before the funeral. Therefore, this ritual, as with others, is not a normal practice. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Is eating a sandwich a requirement of graduating?\nReasoning: Graduating is an event when people receive a diploma. In the event of a delay of this event, those that did not graduate will be asked to eat a sandwich. So, this requirement is to have an actual event to provide this need. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Can humans make music and play instruments?\nReasoning: Humming can be considered music.",

        "<strong>A funeral is a somber, sad event. Blowouts are celebrations of life and not associated with funereal events.</strong> Also, funereal ceremonies were held in churches, so the candle was in a different place.

        "70% of suburban dwellers drive to work every day. The reason for this is that driving to work is cheaper than public transit (especially in New York City), taking a bus or a subway is often inconvenient in the suburbs, and a drive to work gives better office space than a train.

Therefore, Neville Longbottom has more courage as a child than an adult.",
        "17 years previous to the first book of the Harry Potter series, Neville was a shy 13-year-old. In the books, Neville is courageous. In the films, he is a cowardly 17-year-old. Thus, Neville Longbottom can be more courageous either as a child or as an adult, which means that the answer is both \u201cYes and no.\u201d\nThe other two questions are not so straightforward. As shown in the reasoning above, it is okay to say these answers are both \u201cYes and no\u201d because a person\u2019s courage as an adult is equal to the courage of a child. To see why, examine the concept in more detail, or use the link for how courage is defined.\nHowever, if you\u2019re not inclined to delve into the details of the concept, here is the correct answer.\nQuestion: Can a 17-year-old survive a day in New York City?\nAnswer: No\nQuestion",

Therefore, the only time we can calculate if Linus Torvalds makes money off of DirectX is when Linus Torvalds is alive and not making any money at all. However, Linus Torvalds is around 55 years old. Thus, it is very unlikely that Linus Torvalds makes money off of DirectX. However, Linus Torvalds has his own company that is part of Open Source that does not sell anything yet. So, for the sake of the argument, let\u2019s consider Linus Torvalds to be making money off DirectX. Thus, the answer is yes.",

There were very few countries in the world at the time of King Leonidas, which means very few composers.\n3. If King Leonidas had Mozart himself at his disposal, then King Leonidas would have succeeded with an army the size of Mozart's compositions.

        "200,000 soldiers is a large army. Only a relatively small number of compositions written by Mozart's entire lifetime (25) would likely require the 200,000 men. King Leonidas had 10,000 soldiers. Thus, King Leonidas had far fewer soldiers than required for a 15-year war with Sparta. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no",
        "300 Greek warriors defeated an army the size of Mozart\u2019s compositions. Mozart\u2019s \u201cDon Giovanni\u201d has 147 scenes.

        "1. The molecular formula of inopropyl alcohol is C3H7OH. When there are several bonds to a common atom, the prefix is used to indicate the number of atoms of the first atom in the formula. (Isopropyl alcohol has to <i>prefix</i> = 3). 2. The molecular formula of salt is NaCl. When there is more than one element in the formula, the plural of the first part is used in the prefix and the element that comes after it is used in the suffix. Thus, the molecular formula of salt has the prefix salt(s) or salt(s) and the suffix \u2013ide. This means the salt dissolves easier than the alcohol because salt dissolves easily in water. 3. Salts dissolve easily in water.",
        "1 mL of isopropyl alcohol is approximately 76 mg. 3.2 g of salt weighs approximately 3,200 mg. Thus, there is greater than 1 mL of alcohol to dissolve 3.2 g of salt, which is more than 3.2 mL. Thus, the solubility of salt in isopropyl alcohol is high. So the answer is yes.",
        "1 liter of isopropyl alcohol can dissolve 5-7 grams of salt. So, in isopropyl alcohol, the solubility of salt is low. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nIn the following examples, identify the two items being compared and provide reasoning.\n1. How many feet are there in a mile?\nReasoning: A mile is one-sixteenth of a nautical mile. A nautical mile is 6,080 feet. So, there are approximately 1,650 feet in a mile.\n2. How tall is the Great Pyramid of Giza?\nReasoning: The height of the Great Pyramid is 481-483 feet.\n3. Is the human population increasing or decreasing with time?\nAnswer: increasing\n4. Does the United States have a majority non-White population?\nAnswer: no. 79.32% White, 12.8% Hispanic,",
        "2-propanol is the other name for isopropyl alcohol. Thus, this question is asking about isopropyl alcohol. In the chart, isopropyl alcohol\u2019s solubility is listed in the column for low.\nAnswer: yes",
        "3 molecules of water per oxygen in an alcohol produces 2 polar bonds. For water, each hydrogen ionizes, so it can pick up an additional 2 positive ions (Na+ or K+). For salt, each salt ionizes, so it can pick up 8 positive ions (Na+ or K+).\nThe net number of positive ions in the water and salt is the same, so there is the same number of ions for each type. Each water molecule is the same with each salt ion. So the number of water molecules per salt ion is the same for water and salt. Therefore, the solubility of salt is the same for water and salt.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Why can the color pink appear red?\nReasoning: The molecules of an object absorb and reflect the colors of the spectrum.

        "1. Ahura Mazda wants to see Abaddon as a ruler. If Ahura Mazda ascends, he needs to see Abaddon, which means looking up. 2. Abaddon's dwelling is underneath, or below, a mountain, which means on one side of the mountain from, or looking down upon. 3. 1 is a directional term: \"up\"; 2 is a directional term: \"down,\" which is exactly the opposite of the directional term \"up\" and thus can also be translated as \"down.\" 4. Directional terms, especially \"up\" and \"down,\" represent opposites of the same thing. Thus, Ahura Mazda could only see Abaddon on his downward side. 5. Ahura Mazda's residence does not contain an upside down (reversed) image of Abaddon. Hence, Ahura Mazda will be able to see Abaddon. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes",
