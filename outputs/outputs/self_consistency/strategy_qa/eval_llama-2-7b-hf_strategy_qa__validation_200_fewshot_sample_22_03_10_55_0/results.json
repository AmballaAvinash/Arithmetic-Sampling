        "200 years before Homer, Thucydides mentioned an Achilles, so Achilles was likely a real person. 250 years before Homer, Plutarch referred to \u201cthe descendants of Achilles\u201d as living in the area to the west of the Achelous River in Italy. 200 years before Homer, the Geographer Strabo mentioned peoples \u201cdescended from Achilles.\u201d 230 years before Homer, Athenaeus referred to \u201ca locality called Achilleion\u201d in Thrace, in eastern Macedonia. Given these facts, it is likely that Achilles was a direct descendent of Gaia. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes",
        " Achilles\u2019 mother, Thetis, was a goddess with a mortal father. Thetis\u2019 father was said to be the Titan, Briareus, or Poseidon. Thus, Achilles\u2019 mortal grandfather (either Briareus or Poseidon) was Gaia. Thetis and Achilles\u2019 father were thus descendants of Gaia. Gaia was, at that time, the sole goddess. Thus, when Gaia died, Thetis and Achilles became the sole goddesses (Titan Achilles, not Titan Prometheus, having been murdered by Cronus and Zeus for making humans from clay.) The answer to our question, then, is Yes.\n(We\u2019ll continue the answer to this problem below.)\nOur argument that Achilles\u2019 grandfather must have been Gaia proceeds as follows:\nIf Gaia\u2019s mortal",
        "\u200b\nYes: Achilles was a direct descendant of Xenos. Pete is Xenos\u2019s spouse (who, per Poseidon, is the spouse of Xenos\u2019s spouse). Xenos\u2019s son-in-law is Achilles\u2019s father. Thus, Achilles is Xenos\u2019s son-in-law, and hence, a direct descendant of Xenos (via the wife of Xenos\u2019s son-in-law).\nNo: Xenos is Pete\u2019s spouse. Pete\u2019s son-in-law is Achilles\u2019s father. Achilles is not Pete\u2019s son-in-law, so Achilles is not Xenos\u2019s son-in-law, and hence, not a direct descendant of Xenos (via the wife of Xenos\u2019s son-in-law).\nComment: The",
        "4 years before dying Achilles was bit by a viper by the River Styx, making his life short-lived. Achilles was the son of Thetis and Zeus. The Greeks named the location at the mouth of the River Styx Achilles\u2019 Tomb. Gaia had a long life and she was the goddess of earth and of the soil. Thus, Achilles could be a direct descendent of Gaia. So the answer is yes.\nQuestion: Is this the only continent that starts with an \u201cA\u201d?\nReasoning: Only continents that exist are counted. So, Antarctica is not on the list. The other five continents are Asia, Africa, Europe, Australia, and North America. One can reason that the other four continents are in order (because Africa is before Europe), so the first one is Asia or Australia. Since Australia does not begin with an \u201cA,\u201d Asia is the only",
        "1) Although we do not have a full list of Achilles\u2019 ancestors, 1/4 of his ancestors could have been Gaia. 2) 1/4 x 1/4 = 1/16. 3) Gaia had 16 times as many descendants as Achilles. Thus, Achilles could have had only two-thirds as many direct descendents as Gaia. 4) One-third is larger than one-half.

So Yes.\nIf Yes, then it seems to me that you will have an MP3 file that includes the view (or views, if it's a series) of the Golden Gate Bridge.\nIf No, then the bridge is somehow related to the audio format. Maybe they're",
        "2014 was before 2015. 2015 = MP3. Therefore, it is possible to make an MP3 from the Golden Gate Bridge in 2014. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: The 911 phone call made in the past was heard by present-day listeners?\nReasoning: The present day listener hears the call in 2014. The phone call took place in 2001 (13 years ago at the time of this question). Thus, it took three years for a present-day listener to hear the call in 2014 (which is after 2001, the time of the the 911 phone call). This is why the listener who hears the call in 2014 hears a 911 phone call that took place in the past. So the answer is yes",
        " You can listen to the Golden Gate Bridge.  The Golden Gate Bridge is located near San Francisco, CA, USA.  The United States has a system of laws.  The system of laws created the United States.  You can listen to music; thus, all systems of laws contain rules which enable listening to music.  You can get an MP3 anywhere in the world; thus, the law of gravity allows you to do so.  We know this because Newton came up with the law of gravity. Newton applied for a patent for the law of gravity in 1662.  This patent was granted in 1664. You can listen to music in a restaurant. Thus, you can make an MP3 in a restaurant.

So it is conceivable that you could make an MP3 from the Golden Gate Bridge. Thus, the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nYou can do the same thing on the exam, but it's usually not as detailed. Usually, the reasoning is a bit vague. The professor may be suggesting that it's possible that you can make an MP3, but that it is not obvious how to do it. They will then ask you if it is feasible.\nThe question is not whether the Golden Gate Bridge can be turned into an MP3 file\u2014it can't.

Each of these Olympics can be thought of as in the western hemisphere (the United States plus all of Central and South America). Thus, Evander Holyfield may have competed in an Olympics in the western hemisphere.\n**Note: This reasoning is the exception to the rule given above. This reasoning is tricky because we are taking a single event (the Olympics) and breaking it down to 4 discrete components (4 Olympics). Thus, we should be able to say whether it is possible to hold an Olympic-type competition in the western hemisphere.\nAnswer: no (I don\u2019t think this reasoning is the most general rule \u2013 but it works)\nQuestion: Are the number of spongebob square pants songs more than the number of all US Presidents",

The gestation period for a llama is 11 months, which is more than 6 months. Thus, a llama could not give birth twice during the War in Vietnam. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Would a pear sink in water?\nReasoning: The density of a pear is about 0.6 g/cm3, which is less than water. Objects less dense than water float. Thus, a pear would float. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Hydrogen\u2019s atomic number squared exceeds number of Spice Girls?\nReasoning: Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1. 1 squared is 1. There are 5 Spice Girls. Thus, Hydrogen\u2019s atomic number squared is less than 5. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Is it common to see frost during some college commencements?\nReasoning: College commencement ceremonies can happen in December, May, and June. December is in the winter, so there can be frost. Thus, there could be frost at some commencements. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nLike each of the previous examples, answer the following question with Yes or No, and provide the reasoning as demonstrated in the examples.\nQuestion: Could a hundred thousand lolcats fit on a first generation iPhone?\nReasoning: ",
      "reference": "no",
      "prediction": "yes",
      "generation_candidates": [
        "100,000 lolcats equals approximately 3% of the first generation iPhone. The iPhone has a capacity of 4 gigabytes. Thus, 100,000 lolcats can fit on an iPhone. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Is it feasible for an iPhone to contain the complete works of Shakespeare?\nReasoning: iPhone has a capacity of 4Gb. It is feasible to store the complete works of Shakespeare. Thus, an iPhone could be used to store the complete works of Shakespeare. Thus, the answer to this yes or no question is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Does the 112th state have twelve letters in its name?\nReasoning: 112th = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1. If a state has 32 letters in its name, that is 1 + i",
        "1/3 of a megabyte is 0.342 MB. There are 2.8 MPP in one megabyte, and MPP means million pixels. We do not know how large a lolcat is, but it is usually a small picture. 0.342 MB is more than 968,000 pixels. Thus lolcats cannot consume all of the memory in a 1st generation iPhone. Therefore the answer is no.\nQuestion: Would a bale of hay be equal to one square meter?\nReasoning: One bale of hay is equal to 1.3 cubic meters. 1 cubic meter equals 1 thousand kilograms. 1 kilogram equals 1 thousand grams. 1 gram equals one cubic centimeter. 1 square meter equals 1 thousand cubic centimeters. So, 1 bale of hay has the same volume",
        "0.96 megapixels on a phone is less than 1 million pixels. 100,000 pixels is 5116.57 images. Thus, there is not enough space on the phone screen to fit 5116.57 lolcats. Hence, it is not possible to fit a hundred thousand lolcats onto a first generation iPhone. A screen that is only capable of displaying 96,000 pixels at any time could hardly support that many, let alone 5116.57 images (which would require displaying the images simultaneously on the screen). So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nThe preceding four questions all asked for a yes or no answer, and reasoning was supplied for each of the yes answers. In this example, we will ask for a yes or answer with no explanation.\nQuestion: Is it likely that more Americans than Britons know why \u201c",
        "10,000 / 0.3 = 33 333 cats / square inch, which is less than the iPhone display\u2019s width and height of 3.5 inches each. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: no!\nQuestion: Is it possible to be a doctor and also a teacher?\nReasoning: A medical doctor can be referred to as a doctor, which is what the person who graduated from a 4-year medical degree program would be called. A medical doctor is not the same thing as a teacher. Thus, they can be different things at the same time. So the answer is yes.\nQuestion: Could we have had 70 billion seconds since the Big Bang if the universe is only 13.8 billion years old?\nReasoning: If the universe is 13.8 billion years old, then you can have 70 billion seconds since the Big Bang.",
        "100,000 is about 250 iPhone capacity. Thus, a hundred thousand lolcats could fit on a first generation iPhone. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion 6:\nQuestion: Would a dog be able to survive on candy as its diet?\nReasoning: A dog needs vitamins from a variety of food sources. Candy is just sugar, and does not have the variety of nutrients a dog needs. So it is unlikely that a dog could survive on a diet solely of candy, especially over the long term. Thus, the answer is likely no.\nAnswer: likely no\n1.8.

        " It is conceivable that phone manufacturers made phones with multiple lines available in 1876 when Alexander Graham Bell invented the phone. If there was a single  line available, Bell could use all the time available with his call waiting. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Would a cat jump off the Empire State Building if the building and the cat had no gravity?\nReasoning: Gravity is a constant. The effect of the cat jumping would be unaffected by gravity or the lack of gravity. The cat\u2019s jump cannot be affected by any external forces. Thus, a cat would jump if the building that it is on had  no gravity.

Since you can see Australia from space, you would see a cow flying to Australia. So the answer is yes.\nQuestion: Can you make the sun\u2019s diameter?\nReasoning: The sun is larger than any known planet, so it is not possible to make the sun\u2019s diameter.

        "6 Flags Over Georgia is in America. Justin Timberlake grew up in America. Thus, it may be possible for Justin Timberlake to ride Shipwreck Falls at Six Flags Over Georgia. So the answer is _____.\nAnswer: yes\n**Note:** It is easy to see that this is the correct answer. However, it is helpful to remember that the logic for every statement _should_ be the same. This means that every time you prove that something is true, you should have enough information to prove that it is also false. In other words, a yes statement should also hold a \"counter-example\" that shows why it could be false and the same technique could be used to solve any question or real problem. It just takes practice!\n# The _No_ Answer\nSo far we have looked at a variety of statements that are true. But a statement can be either _true_ or _false_ or neither,",
        "\u200bWhen you enter Six Flags, you are required to purchase a Six Flags ticket. \u200bTherefore, Shipwreck Falls is only accessible if you have a ride pass to Six Flags.

To answer this loaded question, you must determine what information is being hidden from the reader. This question is loaded because the premise is faulty. It is implied that only DNA that contains the human genome would be required for mapping, so the statement, \"When you enter Six Flags, you are required to purchase",

The answer to each question is simple to know by looking at its information, just like the answers to this example question.\nIf you look at the entire SAT, it is actually a lot more challenging to get a high score. How often can you answer questions for large numbers of them, and what level of reasoning do you need to use on the questions to which you cannot answer for a large number of them? How critical of thinking of a level is required?\nIt is useful to classify each of the reasoning processes seen in the previous chapters",
        "13 inches is 1 foot. Justin Timberlake is 5 feet 9 inches tall. Thus, Justin Timberlake can ride Shipwreck Falls at Six Flags. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nWhen an argument can be made for more than one possible answer, the ambiguous answer will be the most common. It is the easiest answer to choose because it is the one the instructor is least likely to know right away. Therefore, it also tends to be considered acceptable by the instructor.\nAn incorrect answer will be a bit more difficult to defend. It will take time for the instructor to figure out whether or not the answer is incorrect. You will gain points, but probably not large amounts of points.\nA false answer, which you will sometimes find in multiple-choice questions, is the easiest to defend to the instructor. It is the most likely answer, and the one that will be chosen most often"

For example, some probability calculators estimate probability 0.8 x 10-2, meaning a 0.0008% chance. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\n6.1 Logical Inference\nLogic is the study of argument. All of us are subject to the influence of an argument, and the goal of logic is to avoid errors of logic.\nThere are many different forms of reasoning. A key form is logical inference, which can be viewed as the process of establishing a belief by reasoning from evidence. Logical inference uses three basic inferential devices: inference to the best explanation, deduction, and induction.\nAn explanation is an answer to a question; what is the best explanation of the following: why does my computer not work? We might",
        "2023 will be the first time a descendant of the Mongols is likely to be in the United Kingdom because 2022 is the 800th anniversary of the Death of Genghis Khan (the father of the Mongols). An estimated 2000 to 3000 people descended from the Mongols live in the United Kingdom. Wembley stadium can hold about 90,000 people. Thus, there could be 4.5 to 7 descendant of the Mongols at Wembley stadium. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nAs a reminder, there are two ways to avoid questions such as these:\n1. You could stop preparing for competitions; and\n2. You could not start any research projects related to your specialty.\nWhile I would argue that if you are interested in your area, you should prepare for the compet",

        "1. The size of a Mozart composition is determined by time (i.e. the duration of the composition). According to the example above, the duration of Mozart\u2019s compositions were in the range of 60 seconds. 2. Therefore, according to item 1 the size of an army of Mozart\u2019s is in the range of 15 to 40 min. 3. Because King Leonidas lost the Battle of Thermopylae in one day against a much larger Persian army, his army must have been of no better than 15 min or worse an army of 40 min. 4. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that while King Leonidas did, in fact, succeed in Thermopylae, he could not have done so with an army the size of Mozart\u2019s compositions. The question answer is No.",
        "2016 marks Mozart\u2019s 260th Birthday. This means that Mozart had about 416 compositions in his lifetime. This is less than King Leonidas\u2019 army size which was around 300,000 soldiers. Thus, King Leonidas would not have been able to succeed with an army the size of Mozart\u2019s compositions.\nAnswer: no\nThere were some interesting questions and some interesting answers \u2014 some of which probably made you laugh, or made you scratch your head, or even made you think for a moment.\nIf you were unsure about the answers, click below to expand the response explanations. I have included the reasoning provided in the original prompt, the explanation for the correct answer, and my own take on the question.",
        "\u200bKing Leonidas had 300 Spartans. According to wikipedia, Mozart composed over 600 pieces. Thus, King Leonidas had a larger army than Mozart. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Would a fish live longer than a dolphin in the Great Lakes?\nReasoning: \u200bThe average lifespan of a dolphin is 54 years, but the average lifespan of a fish is 30-50 years. Some fish live up to 100 years. Thus, if the fish lives 50 years it would live a longer life than the average dolphin. So the answer is yes.\nQuestion: Would an elephant have longer ears than a giraffe?\nReasoning: \u200bGiraffes have oversized ears. They also have the longest necks. Elephants don't",
        "300 Spartans faced 300,000 Persians on Thermopylae. This was a classic Greek victory. In comparison, W.A. Mozart composed 41 symphonies. Thus, with his smaller army, Leonidas certainly could have had a worse fate. So the answer is yes.\nQuestion: Would a fish swim to the bottom of the ocean?\nReasoning: Fish are aquatic. Fish do not typically swim to the bottom of the ocean. Some fish have bioluminescence, which helps them swim higher in the water. However, this does not help them reach the bottom of the ocean. So the answer is yes.\nQuestion: Is a hamster a prey animal?\nReasoning: The classification of an organism depends on its lifestyle. Thus, based on the life cycle and nutritional cycle of hamsters, we would expect hamsters to",
        "40,000 was the number of warriors that King Leonidas had. The number of compositions by Mozart is not recorded. However, Mozart wrote at least 620 pieces. Thus, Mozart could have an army larger than 40,000. So the answer is yes.\nQuestion: Would the moon look bigger when viewed from the Southern Hemisphere?\nReasoning: The moon is larger in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere is where people live in North America. Thus, the moon would look bigger in North America when viewed from the Southern Hemisphere.

He does not refuse to seek medical treatment from a Catholic physician.  Further, Catholicism has a clear and well-defined belief system that could allow for acceptance of medical treatment from a Catholic physician.  Thus, it is extremely likely that Richard Dawkins would accept medical treatment from Catholic physician, thus he accepts an offering of the Last rites.

There are therefore at least two independent pieces of evidence that he would reject the Last Rites. So the answer is Yes.\nAnswer: Yes.\nQuestion: Could a single pair of scissors remove all of the hair from a dog?\nReasoning: 1) If a pair of scissors cuts through a line of weak fibers (hair) then it can remove hair. 2) A line of weak fibers will not contain another line of weaker fibers; since hair\u2019s fiber is weaker than that of clothes, hair cannot be cut shorter by the weaker fiber of clothes.
