        "1. Bob Marley, who was a Jamaican, has children. 2. Kublai Khan, whose kingdom was in modern-day China, died in 1294 (around the year 1294). 3. The rules of tug of war may not change over hundreds of years. Thus, we can assume that Kublai Khan (through his children) would still be able to participate in tug of war as of May 20, 2020 (over 700 years after he died). This means that Bob Marley's children are probably younger than Kublai Khan's children, since Bob Marlay died in 1981. Thus, the answer should be yes, and the children of each of these two men could hypothetically participate in tug of war together.\nQuestion: Would a pear fall if dropped in an empty plane?\nReasoning",

Ramadan is typically in the month of Ramadan, so 6 weeks could be less or greater than a month. It matters for the reasoning because if it is a smaller value than 6 weeks, then the writer could not fast during Ramadan, since Ramadan is longer.\nIf a person observes a holiday all month long, then that person cannot fast during the holiday month. Example: if a person cannot eat food all month, then that person cannot eat food during the holiday month, since food is the reason for not eating it in the holiday month.

Thus, The Invisible Man is not included in films as much as Picnic at Hanging Rock. Thus, the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nHow are we using the questions to understand the reasoning?\nIn the first question, we can tell that we need a rule that is the opposite of the rule \"an object's weight is more than its density\" because we want an object's weight to be less than its density. This means that we need to set an object's weight equal to or greater than its density, so that the answer is no.\nThe second question is a little trickier.

        "1. Back pain people are more likely to enjoy picking strawberries. 2. Someone who enjoys picking strawberries does not have back pain. 3. Someone who enjoys picking strawberries cannot be someone who has back pain. So the answer can be either way, but is more likely to be yes.\nAnswer: Yes\n# Exercise 6.3: Avoiding Waffling\nWhile writing an ELI section, the more words you use the fewer correct answers you will get. So don't use extra words! Avoid common, unavailing explanations of \"maybe\" and \"some people.\" Avoid circular, or repetitive arguments that use your words to say the same thing over and over again.\nWhen the correct answer is \"Avoid using non-verbs (e.g., \"can\" and \"could\") and negative verbs, such as \"",
        "1. Being out in the sun can relieve back pain. 2. Being outdoors can relieve back pain. 3. Picking strawberries is being outdoors. Thus, someone with back pain would enjoy it. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes.\n##\nUsing the Right Word\nMost of the time there's no reason to use more words than are necessary (remember Rule #8). But what if you overthink the simple phrasing? Or worse, use a word wrong?\nSay you're going to write the following: \"The first step is deciding whether you would do it or not.\" It's a straightforward sentence, yet the wrong word is hiding in plain sight:\nThat first sentence is incorrect. There's no need to say that someone has to decide whether they \"would do it or not,\" as opposed to \"do it or not.\" Saying it either",

But you don't need to know hypothesis tests to understand this chapter.\nYou do need to know how to compare data. The idea of a statistical comparison is that you would like to say that A is more (better) than B, or A is worse than B, or that A and B are the same. You need to know how to do these statistical comparisons.\nAs an example, we'll assume that two departments of a large company, Accounting and Marketing, want to compare whether their workers are different. The workers are measured for how long"

        "2 years ago, Alan Rickman died of cancer. Cancer is caused by changes in cells. Mutations occur when a cell is dividing. When cells divide, they copy their content. These copies can have mutations, so they are not the same as the original cells. When a mutation occurs in a cell that is dividing, the cell can stop dividing, die, and become an error in the dividing process. A mutation in one cell will affect all cells created from the abnormal cell. Mutations in cells can cause cancers.\nThus, cells can have mutations. Organisms can be classified by the complexity of the organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. People belong to genus _Homo, and have cells.

        "5.5 gallons of water is required for daily activity. This equates to about 108 ounces of water. The total length of episodes in the EastEnders television show series is about 5,000 minutes. Thus, we can convert total minutes to an equivalent ounces of water through the formula 34 minutes of TV = 34 ounces of water. As such, a viewer would need about 1266 ounces of water to watch 5,000 minutes, which is about 55 hours of non-stop TV. At a rate of 3 ounces of water per minute of non-stop TV, a viewer would need 182 ounces of water for non-stop TV.

Instead, they should focus on thinking about and decoding spoken words.\nAs explained in Part I of this series, when you first learn a language, you have to decode words, and that process takes a lot of time and effort. Your decoding skills, however, become automatic over time. If you try to be precise without considering your decoding skills, you will almost certainly have misunderstandings.\nBy contrast, when you first learn spoken words, you have to encode them. The encoding process is much faster than decoding and requires much less effort. Like decoding, it is a subconscious ability. You need very little conscious focus to produce speech or listen to others. The encoding/decoding processes are mutually",

Thus, Neanderthals possessed less intelligence and shorter memory than modern adults. Most research indicates that humans used arithmetic during the Late Stone Age (100,000-6500YBP), but Neanderthals probably went extinct 50,000-50,000Ya, and Neanderthal remains only date to 40,000 years ago.

Immersion in virtual reality is not testable on cnidarians before humans.\nWhat\u2019s Wrong With the Question: False\nThis question has a serious inconsistency in the language. The question asks, \u201cIs X testable on cnidarians before humans?\u201d Here is a translation of that statement: If something is testable on cnidarians before humans, then that thing is an ability. Now, by definition, an ability is something that you can do. But X is not an ability. So we can conclude that this statement is false.\nAnswer: False\nAnswer the following question with No",
        "200 years of scientific progress has taught us that humans, unlike cnidarians, are the sole animals that evolved visual cortexes, giving us the ability to perceive objects of all sizes, distances, and angles. Therefore, the test to determine if a human is immersed in virtual reality cannot be performed on cnidarians since cnidarians do not have comparable neurological capabilities; so the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\n# PART III\u2014HALCYTON (FLEXIBILITY)\nThe ability to consider multiple perspectives is an important aspect of the intelligence quotient. It is one of the most widely accepted theories of intelligence\u2014that it is necessary to be able to take different perspectives, to \"flex\" one's cognitive processes. In 2012, there was a large study published by _Science_ magazine, which reviewed",
        "60% of the adult cnidarians (the phylum that includes corals and anemones) are hermit crabs. To the best of our knowledge, neither humans nor any of the roughly 200 species of hermit crabs can be immersion in virtual reality. We know this because all the tests described in this book are tests on humans. Since there are no other known animals with the property tested, we can safely conclude that the test cannot possibly have precondition (3).\nAnswer: Not sure\nThe test has at least one precondition. What is it? Is the test possible before the precondition? If not, should the test be called testable? Explain why you answered as you did about the testability.\n3.3.2 Testability of Tests\nThe last two examples demonstrate that the question we consider is not only about testability but also how to evaluate the possibility of an animal being imm",
        "90% of the human brain is based on the cerebral cortex. Most mammals have a higher percentage of cerebral cortex, and only slightly more than 40% of the brain of cnidarians is based on the cerebral cortex. Thus, most of the human brain is based on cnidarians. Thus, virtual reality immersion should be testable on cnidarians before humans. So the answer is yes.\nQuestion: Does Pete Doherty ever appear in any music video?\nReasoning: The White Stripes had a video for their song \u201cNine Million Bicycles\u201d.

        "1 million American babies were born between 1980 and 2003. One of them (i.e., 0.00093) was named Michael. Since 0.00093 is less than 0.001, we can conclude that that Michael is a less common male first name. Thus, the answer is Yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Is \"the\" a male or female name?\nReasoning: The is an inanimate object (i.e., a pronoun), not a name. Thus, the answer is No.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Does \"evanescence\" mean \"disappearance\"?\nReasoning: \"Evanescence\" and \"disappearance\" mean the same thing, so Yes would be correct.\nAnswer: Yes\nSometimes it is not as easy a decision\nSuppose you are watching a television",

        "29 of 31 maritime pilots who recovered from COVID-19 also had symptoms. They have been shown to have had high viral loads as well. Thus, COVID-19 has the potential to spread to maritime pilots. So the answer is Yes.\nAnswer: Yes",
        "2020 is a leap year, so we have 29 days in February and 30 days in all other months. COVID-19 is transmitted through droplets that may form in sneezes and coughs. Maritime pilots are very often in close proximity to one another, so they can catch COVID-19 from each other, thereby spreading the virus. This has also been demonstrated empirically. Maritime pilots are more likely to be infected by COVID-19 than drivers of semitractors. Thus they're more likely to spread COVID-19 than drivers of semitrailers. The COVID-19 virus cannot spread through smell, because olfactory cells have no nuclei. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nWhat Is Rational Driving?\nAs we did earlier in this chapter, let's start to develop a framework by looking at what rational",

        "600 health care workers in the United Kingdom died of COVID-19, which is much higher than the risk of death from maritime pilots on the river Thames, which is about 1 in 500,000. So COVID-19 cannot kill 600 health care workers in the United Kingdom, which is much more than 1 in 500,000. Since the risk of death from COVID-19 is less than the risk of death from a maritime pilot on the river Thames, COVID-19 cannot spread to maritime pilots.

The last two decades have seen tremendous advances in technology, science, and medicine. These advances have led to stunning innovations and benefits, but the negative consequences of these innovations have become increasingly obvious. Robot warriors are more powerful than human warriors. Genetic engineering has the potential to improve or diminish human life depending on the whims of its creators. Artificial intelligence has the potential to eliminate any meaningful human control over whoever or whatever it can replace us. While the future does indeed hold the potential for tremendous human progress, it also carries potentially tragic ris",

Thus, the COVID-19 virus could spread to maritime pilots. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nThere was a rumor that the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted within a marriage. The rumor alleged that the COVID-19 virus could spread from one spouse to the other after having dinner together. Although there was ample anecdotal evidence for this rumor, the actual data were not available.

Therefore, the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nCHAPTER 10\nTHE SEARCH FOR CERTAINTY\nWhile certainty in the business world has value, certainty in the court of law is considered dangerous. This is because certainty in the criminal justice system can be abused to the detriment of the rights of the accused. This is illustrated in the example of John E. Huff, a former Georgia judge who was imprisoned for the murder",

But when the Andromeda galaxy collided with our Milky Way galaxy, their orbits were disrupted and Phobos moved to the opposite side of the Solar System and was no longer near the Andromeda galaxy. Thus, Phobos is not part of the Andromeda galaxy. So the answer is no.\nQuestion: Were the Bermuda Triangle and Stonehenge built by Nazi spies?\nReasoning: The Bermuda Triangle didn\u2019t exist until the 1940s. Nazi spies were defeated in 1945.

        "\u03d5 means 22 over 5 in Greek, and it was derived from a Greek term for \"love\". In ancient Greek culture, \"love\" had negative connotations and was not the positive, romantic or sexual connotation it has today. Thus, Phobos was a Greek asteroid with negative connotations. Also, Phobos was about as wide as Pluto and had a density about half that of Phobos (19). Andromeda is also known as the Great Andromeda Galaxy or the Andromeda Nebula. Andromeda is also known as Milk Dipper in Hindi. Andromeda is the highest density galaxy in our universe. Andromeda contains a star that has become so massive that it could swallow a planet almost whole, which is quite different from our usual definition of \"swallow\", but the distinction shouldn\u2019t be too surprising (20). So the answer is no.",

We are looking at a statement and saying \"yes it's true\" or \"no it's false\" through the use of objects.",
        "1615 was a leap year\u2014it had one extra day in February. This may cause some confusion if you are reading through the book.\nReasoning: Native American tribes and Mexico share a border. It\u2019s possible that the land north of Mexico was under the control of Native American tribes\u2014specifically the Aztec tribes (more on these tribes as the book progresses). However, the 1615 treaty was focused on Spain and England. Spain and England are in the Atlantic Ocean, which means that the borderland and the northern area of Mexico would have to be over water or on land that the tribes controlled. So if the tribes controlled this border area, then the tribes could teach them how to cultivate maize. That said, the borderland could be shared by tribes and Mexicans, but if it\u2019s possible that the land belongs to tribes, then it is likely that the tribes could teach.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion",
        "1621 was in the 17th century. Europeans came to the Americas in the 1400s. Thus, the Native American tribes could have taught Spain about maize growing earlier in the 1400s. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Is the sum of two negative 4 a negative?\nReasoning: 4 is negative. Negative plus negative is negative. Thus, \u20134 is negative. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Can a star pass through Jupiter?\nReasoning: Jupiter is a planet. The term planet describes celestial objects that orbit around the sun (and not around another celestial object). A star orbits around a galaxy (not around the sun) so a star cannot pass through Jupiter. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Do humans experience more births than ice",
        "1514-1548 is a big time period! During that time, many generations of Native Americans and Spaniards lived. Thus, we need to consider other factors to determine if Spaniards learned maize cultivation from Native Americans. There is a very good chance the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: How is the color of the pennies used for the United States Mint?\nReasoning: Pennies used for U.S. Mint are only minted in the United States of America. Color may change during circulation because of contaminants in the metal, but color is not an important factor in the coins\u2019 value. Thus, the color of pennies used for the United States Mint is irrelevant. The pennies\u2019 color could be green, red, or blue for all intents and purposes. Therefore, pennies\u2019 color likely does not affect their value.\nAnswer"

The first example can be explained by the fact that frost can occur during any of the three college commencement months. As such, to eliminate the ambiguity, a YES answer is best. The second example presents an animal providing a service to other animals based on what that animal eats and what it provides to other animals in return. Given that hamsters are considered prey, their job is to be eaten by predators. A predator, in turn, is an animal that requires food to sustain its",

A common assumption is that people are hungry when they are famished. Famine is the scarcity of the food supply, so famished people would not have access to large amounts of the same type of food. If the people are only a little hungry, then it is easy to eat more food over a span of time. So we can only say no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Do some kinds of fish live in swamps?\nReason",

For this reason, it would be unfair to consider the existence of a punishment, alone, as a reason to violate the Eighth Amendment. To answer more thoroughly, a court would have to consider the severity of keelhauling compared to the severity of other punishments, the severity of keelhauling compared to similar punishments, how long keelhauling has been around, and if, and to what extent, keelhauling has been used in modern times.
