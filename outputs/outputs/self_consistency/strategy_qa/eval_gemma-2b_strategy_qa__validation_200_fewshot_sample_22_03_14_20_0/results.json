        "2015: December: 4 - Anderson Cooper interviewed the Disney family on his show. Disney's date of birth was November 13, 1901, so the dates he was interviewed would have been on or around his birthday. November 13, 2015, was also 113 years before his date of birth. 113 x 365 = 41,155. Hence, Anderson Cooper interviewed the Disney family approximately 41,155 days after Disney was born. Disney was born 113 years before Anderson Cooper was born. Thus, the two events happened at the same time and would be in the same hemisphere. Hence, there was likely a 2015 photo opportunity with Anderson Cooper (United States of America) and the Disney family (United Kingdom).

        "1. A supersonic shock wave is a shock wave travelling faster than the speed of sound in air or other gaseous mediums. 2. An explosion at a gunpowder storage facility results in the release of gunpowder molecules that travel in the form of a shock wave. 3. No speed greater than the speed of sound can be obtained by a shock wave, which is a mechanical form of a wave. Therefore, a supersonic shock wave would not be created by an explosion at a gunpowder storage facility. 4. The answer is no.\nAnswer: no",
        "1000 pounds of explosives in a 200 feet long silo is 2,000 pounds of TNT. TNT has a reaction rate of 5,100 million tons TNT/sec. Thus, the explosion has a reaction of at least 2 * 5.1 x 108 tons TNT / sec. The speed of sound is 1,200,000 feet per second. The diameter of the planet Earth is about 7,923 miles. Thus, the distance from the explosion to the planet Earth\u2019s surface is 35 x 108 feet. If the Mach number is greater than 1.5, then the shock wave passes through the sphere.

Each grain of hydrogen is 5",
        "3 of the factors determining the distance of the shock wave from the source of impact are density of the air, pressure of the air, and the temperature. When the pressure of the air rises, speed of sound of the air increases, and so increases the distance of the shock wave. Since gunpowder increases temperature of air and also increases pressure of air, the shock wave could travel much farther than normal. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes",
        "4.34 m/s is slower than the speed of sound in water. An explosion could create a shock wave up to the speed of sound in water. So the answer is yes, however an explosion at the site could create a supersonic shock wave. When an explosion creates a \"jet-like\" shock wave, it will be supersonic. So the answer is yes and can be supersonic.",

        "1 kWh is equal to 3.41 GB. To convert kilowatt-hours to gigabytes, divide by 34107. Therefore, 1 kWh is equal to 3.41 GB/kWh. Therefore, 1 kWh is equal to 3.41 GB. Thus, it is possible to produce chaff out of electricity. Therefore, it is false to think that not a single gram of chaff is being produced out of hydropower. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Would I feel pain if the speed of the car that hit me was 8 m/s?\nReasoning: A moving object always exerts force on an object in the same direction as the moving object. If the speed is 0, and the car is not moving, then the force exerted would be 0. A car going 2 m/s exerts a force of 2 N on your body. However, I exert a force of ",
        "1. Hydropower is 1 type of renewable energy. Renewable energy can be produced to supply energy needs 24/7. The majority of the electric power in the US, is generated from 5% hydropower. So, hydropower 100% supplies electric power 24/7. 2. Chaff is made of 100% animal protein. Chaff is used a protein feed for domesticated animals 100% of the time. 3. Feed is generally 100% provided 24/7. Thus, chaff can be made from 100% hydropower production.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Is the moon visible from New York City?\nReasoning: The moon is visible from New York City \u2154 of the time, and below the horizon \u2153 of the time. So the moon could 2/3 of the time be visible from New York City. Thus, the answer is yes.\n",
        "10% of the energy from hydropower comes from friction of passing water on turbine blades and on the riverbed at the intake. Another 15% comes from the conversion of electrical charge. Thus, chaff is a by-product of hydropower.

So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Does all water that is on Earth move towards a planet? If so, please mention the planet.\nReasoning: A planet is defined as having a large mass with a strong gravitational pull. So all water will eventually go to earth. Thus, all water should move towards a planet. The correct answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Would a ball thrown by a professional baseball player have the same speed as a ball hurled by a high school basketball player",
        "1500 MW times the efficiency of conversion to electrical power is 1500 MW times 0.729 or 1086 MW. Multiplying the result in megawatts by 1,000 gives us 1,086,000 MWh. 1,086,000 MWh is the total amount of electricity produced by hydropower from 48 hours of operation. Thus, 48 hours of operation provides sufficient electricity to produce a lot of chaff. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes",
        "1) Chaff is the by-product, or waste, of an operation: To produce chaffed corn, the kernels would have first to be husked and the husks discarded. The kernels would then be ground to flour, which would be used for many purposes. And chaff would be produced from milling processes 2) Hydropower, however, uses water power to generate electricity: The hydropower industry uses water power to generate electricity 3) Hydropower has historically been used only in countries that are in the temperate and tropical locations, mainly because of the availability of appropriate sites (such as dams, for example) and 4) Thus, chaff from hydropower is rarely produced. But since the main application for chaff is as fuel for grain millers, chaff produced by hydropower is used and thus chaff is produced.\nAnswer: no",

Thus, 1.66 kWh*h is equal to 0.151 *kg*kg thus the total mass of the chaff produced by hydropower is between 0 and 1.2 kg. The answer is yes, chaff produced by hydropower may have an impact on biodiversity if it displaces wild birds in the area of the discharge.",
        "<i>Windpower</i> is hydropower. <i>Hydropower</i> is not <i>biofuels</i>, which are made from plant material. So chaff produced by hydropower is not <i>biofuels</i>. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no",

Countries outside the EEA have no obligation to accept an American passport. If there was a passport with an expiration date in a country outside the EEA, then it is possible that the passport could have expired. So the answer is yes.",
        "1 mole of any molecular covalent compound (like salt) requires 1 mole-L of solvent to make a saturated solution. Since the molecular weight (molecular mass) of isopropyl alcohol is 60, the density is 0.8g/mL, and there can be no more than 1 mole of salt in 11mL of isopropyl alcohol at the end of equilibration because that is how much solvent there is, there can be no more than 1 mole of molecules in 11mL. Thus, there is no more than 1 mole of salt in the system, and the solubility of salt is low. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Are 2.7kg of apples enough for 25 people to eat daily?\nReasoning: A medium-sized apple weighs about 60 grams each, making 1 medium apple 300g.

According to that, yes the 8th Amendment would be violated. 8th Amendment: \u201ccruel and unusual punishment prohibited.\u201d The 8th Amendment says that no state can deprive people of punishment that is cruel, unusual, or unusual.

        "1) Keelhauling seems like a barbaric and inhumane punishment. 2) Keelhauling is an example of a cruel punishment under the Eighth Amendment, which prevents the government from punishing people with cruel and unusual punishment. 3) Thus, keelhauling could be a cruel punishment under the 8th Amendment. 4) So, yes, keelhauling would be a fair punishment under the Eighth Amendment.\nAnswer: yes",
        "<em>The trial of William Penn in 1692 for the murder of his wife and a priest was the first recorded case of a sentence of hanging by being hauled like the cargo of a ship</em>. The hanging in his case was made possible by the eighth amendment of the eighteenth century United States Constitution. Thus, keelhauling would have been a fair punishment under the eighth amendment. So the answer is yes.\nQuestion: Would a camel or an ibis swallow a fly?\nReasoning: <em>Ibis, and egrets</em>. Egrets are birds of prey. They may be able to take down prey larger than a fly. However, no known ibis or egret has swallowed a fly. Thus, an ibis or an egret would not swallow a fly, so neither would a camel. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: No\nQuestion: Do all animals sweat?\nReasoning: In <em>the scientific literature</em>. All animals have perspiration, but",
        "26 U.S.C. 1061 is the United States law that is used to determine whether someone has been \u201cdischarged\u201d from the Armed Forces of the United States. The purpose of the Eighth Amendment is to \u201cprotect a defendant from imprisonment for life or death for an offense that by its nature does not bear mandatory punishment,\u201d so, the question is irrelevant to this particular defense. Thus, an illegal conviction does not automatically result in the death penalty. Hence, keelhauling would not be a fair punishment under the Eighth Amendment. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Did the Supreme Court of the United States, in its opinion in Korematsu v. United States, decide that the incarceration of certain Japanese-Americans during World War II was lawful?\nReasoning: The Second Amendment guarantees \u201ca well-regulated militia.\u201d The Militia Act of 1792, which authorized the Federal Militia, has several provisions, including that \u201cNo",

        "8th Amendment: Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\n\nCruel and unusual punishment: A cruel and unusual punishment is any punishment that causes more pain or discomfort than the ordinary punishment of the crime would cause.\n\nExcessive punishment: Excessive punishment is: Punishment that is very severe; or extreme.\n\nKeelhauling is the act of being whipped with a paddle or rope. So, if a person was whipped, it may be considered an extreme, excessive punishment. However, whether or not keelhauling is a cruel and unusual punishment is yet in question. Some say it is cruel, some say it isn\u2019t, so the answer is up for debate. As for other punishments within the Eighth Amendment, some people say they could be too harsh, but there is a lot of evidence to support the argument that all punishments should be fair. For example, electrocution is a very severe punishment, but it cannot be considered cruel and unusual",

This sandwich is simple and easy to understand. We can see that the best part is bacon, followed by cheese, and then the rest of the sandwich. Bacon is simple, tasty, and a standard offering - thus, anyone ordering a bacon sandwich has to ask for that one.\n  In contrast, the three cheese, bacon, and ranch sandwich will often be the second-best sandwich at Cookout.
