      "prompt": "Question: Would a pear sink in water?\nReasoning: The density of a pear is about 0.6 g/cm3, which is less than water. Objects less dense than water float. Thus, a pear would float. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Hydrogen\u2019s atomic number squared exceeds number of Spice Girls?\nReasoning: Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1. 1 squared is 1. There are 5 Spice Girls. Thus, Hydrogen\u2019s atomic number squared is less than 5. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Could Brooke Shields succeed at University of Pennsylvania?\nReasoning: Brooke Shields went to Princeton University. Princeton University is about as academically rigorous as the University of Pennsylvania. Thus, Brooke Shields could also succeed at the University of Pennsylvania. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Do hamsters provide food for any animals?\nReasoning: Hamsters are prey animals. Prey are food for predators. Thus, hamsters provide food for some animals. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Could a llama birth twice during War in Vietnam (1945-46)?\nReasoning: The War in Vietnam was 6 months.

So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: Yes, I won the wizard battle!\nQuestion: Could an ant become a unicorn?\nReasoning: Unicorns are mythical creatures. A unicorn is the mythical representation of a white horse that has a single horn. Ants are real animals, however, they are not mythical creatures, though a single ant could win a fight against a horse. But the size of a horse is much larger than an ant, which means there is no way that an ant would be able to win a fight with a horse!\nAnswer: No ant, not one,",
        "1) Gandalf has the power to create new objects, whereas Rincewind has the power to summon old ones. 2) Gandalf is at least as powerful as other wizards. Gandalf has defeated other wizards. 3) Rincewind once ran out of spells. This situation is similar to the one in which Gandalf needed to create fire from the ground to defeat a horde of dragons. Thus, Gandalf has the power to defeat Rincewind. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Can a person be too tall for space exploration?\nReasoning: 1) Most people have to be tall enough to stand in outer space. 2) Many astronauts and space explorers are tall. 3) Tall, strong people are often strong mentally, as well as physically.

        "<i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is a fantasy. A story about a wizard battling someone else is fantasy. Thus, Gandalf hypothetically defeating Rincewind is fantasy. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: If two electrons could be arranged in a circle, they would fill the outermost orbital of two electrons?\nReasoning: If two electrons could be arranged in a circle, they would fill the outermost orbital of two electrons. In a circle, there are at most 3 electrons per orbital, including electrons. For two electrons in a circle, that means the orbital in the same direction will have 2 electrons and the orbital in the opposite direction will have 2 electrons. Thus, if two electrons could be arranged in a circle, that means that they are opposite electrons in a circle. Each orbital holds 2 electrons, including the outermost electrons and the innermost electrons. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestions: The Sun\u2019s center rotates around",
