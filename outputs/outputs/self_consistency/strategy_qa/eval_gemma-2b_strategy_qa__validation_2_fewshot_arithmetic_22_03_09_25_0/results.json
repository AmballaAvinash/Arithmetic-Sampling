      "prompt": "Question: Would a pear sink in water?\nReasoning: The density of a pear is about 0.6 g/cm3, which is less than water. Objects less dense than water float. Thus, a pear would float. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Hydrogen\u2019s atomic number squared exceeds number of Spice Girls?\nReasoning: Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1. 1 squared is 1. There are 5 Spice Girls. Thus, Hydrogen\u2019s atomic number squared is less than 5. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Could Brooke Shields succeed at University of Pennsylvania?\nReasoning: Brooke Shields went to Princeton University. Princeton University is about as academically rigorous as the University of Pennsylvania. Thus, Brooke Shields could also succeed at the University of Pennsylvania. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Do hamsters provide food for any animals?\nReasoning: Hamsters are prey animals. Prey are food for predators. Thus, hamsters provide food for some animals. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Could a llama birth twice during War in Vietnam (1945-46)?\nReasoning: The War in Vietnam was 6 months. The gestation period for a llama is 11 months, which is more than 6 months. Thus, a llama could not give birth twice during the War in Vietnam. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nLike each of the previous examples, answer the following question with Yes or No, and provide the reasoning as demonstrated in the examples.\nQuestion: Gandalf hypothetically defeats Rincewind in a wizard battle?\nReasoning: ",

Only Rincewind can do this, and all others (including Gandalf) do not have the Ring. Thus, the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Could a horse live for at least one year in an enclosure that is 4 meters high?\nReasoning: A horse has an average height of about 1.50 meters, which equates to 4.92 meters. A horse could not live for at least one year inside a box that is over 1.50 meters high. Thus, the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\n\n\nThe following questions were taken from GMAT practice 2017 Q35.",
        "<i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is a trilogy. As Gandalf is defeated by Rincewind in <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>, he must be defeated by Rincewind in <i>The Two Towers</i> and <i>The Return of the King</i>, in which Rincewind makes a triumphant return to life. If Gandalf can beat Rincewind in one tournament, then he could lose in all the other tournaments. So the answer is yes."
