        " The Harlem Renaissance was from 1918 to 1940.  The height of Capone's Chicago activities during the Allied War on Crime (1926\u201331) coincided with the Golden Age of Chicago in the Harlem Renaissance (1918\u201330) in a variety of ways.  Capone lived on the South Side of Chicago and owned a house on Prairie Avenue.  According to the Chicago Daily Tribune archives, the 1918 World Series, considered to be the golden age of Chicago baseball, took place just weeks after the Black Sox scandal.  Capone was often invited to the World Series due to the numerous box-office and VIP tickets obtained by the Outfit and his connections to sports promoters. During the World Series he met his future mistress Mae Joseph, who danced in his box at the World Series.\nA Chicago History Timeline",
        " Al Capone was imprisoned for 11 years. He began his 11-year sentence July 1931 and was released November 1946. The Harlem Renaissance occurred from 1920 to 1930. Thus, Al Capone could have read works from the Harlem Renaissance. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Can someone weigh 100 kg have a negative body mass index?\nReasoning: To have a negative body mass index, someone must weigh less than 100 kg. Someone who weighs 100 kg has a positive body mass index. Thus, someone who weighs 100 kg cannot have a negative body mass index. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Could an orange have an acidic reaction with lye?\nReasoning: An orange is acidic. Lye",
        "1930 is when The Harlem Renaissance began. Capone went down to Alcatraz in 1931. There are 12 months in a year. Thus, Capone would have had to have been jailed for 12 months (1 year) to visit Alcatraz at any time when the Harlem Renaissance was going on.\nAnswer: no",
        "1924, the year the Harlem Renaissance ended, is earlier than 1929, the year Al Capone went to prison. Thus, Al Capone could not have read works from the Harlem Renaissance\u2014either during their time or upon his release. So the answer is no.\nQuestion: Could a kangaroo successfully fly during a solar eclipse?\nReasoning: The average speed of a kangaroo is about 9 km/h. The speed of light is about 299,792,458 km/s. Thus, the average speed of a kangaroo is much slower than the speed of light during an eclipse. Therefore, a kangaroo wouldn\u2019t be able to fly during a solar eclipse. So the answer is no.\nQuestion: Would more people die for each other in 1910, 1970, or 2030",
        "1929 was the year when the Harlem Renaissance movement started in literature. 1931 was the year Al Capone went to Alcatraz Prison. Alcatraz Prison is in San Francisco Bay. Thus, Al Capone could not have read works from the Harlem Renaissance. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Can an Oreo cookie float in the sea?\nReasoning: Objects with high density \u2013 like rocks \u2013 sink in water.

        "123.456 is the temperature at which helium expands. There is no evidence that the temperature in the Hindenburg was 123.456 degrees Celsius before the explosion. Thus, helium was not at fault for the explosion. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Is it possible to eat a box of cereal before breakfast?\nReasoning: The box contains 27 items. One item is the box, which is not eatable. Thus, there are 26 items left. Each item is one serving. That is 26 servings. Serving size is indicated on cereal boxes. If a box says two servings per container and there are twenty containers per box, then each container has one serving.

        "80,000 tons of Hindenburg were carrying 80 tons of helium. There are 1,000 pounds in a ton. Thus, 80 tons of helium are equal to about 80,001 pounds (rounded up to the nearest thousandth). There is an error of ~0.2% error. Given an error of ~0.2%, the Hindenburg was not full of helium. Thus, helium was not the cause of the Hindenburg explosion, and the answer is no.\nA common trap is to simply say that this question had a mistake and answer any way you want.

        " Helium, being naturally buoyant, is often used to fill hot air balloons to keep them aloft. The Hindenburg was a large hot air balloon that was destroyed when it caught fire and was filled with helium. Thus, helium is not the cause of the Hindenburg explosion because helium caused it to explode. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Are zigzags the same as checkerboard patterns?\nReasoning: Many geometries are made up of zigzags. A checkerboard has 4 different colors which are rotated at right angles with the previous one, so it does not count as a zigzag. Thus, zigzags are different than checkerboard patterns. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Can light be in solid state?\nReasoning: Solid can only be the state of non",
        "\u00adHydrogen causes airships to float in the sky. Helium is lighter than air and creates a higher altitude to lift airships. The Hindenburg was made wholly of Hydrogen when it flew for the final time. Thus, there would be a higher chance of it crashing if Hydrogen was replaced by Helium. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nAs you now know, it is vital to provide the reasoning as opposed to simply saying yes or no. To succeed in the workplace, you may need to argue your case with your boss, and you could easily get the upper hand by providing the right supporting reasoning.\n**CHAPTER 2 EXERCISES**\nExercise 1: Are these reasons for an answer?\nAnswer: yes\nAnswer: no\nIn order to pass this chapter, you should try to answer these sample questions to ensure you fully understand each reason for an",

At this point in history, 1937 to the 1940s, the discovery of helium was still relatively new and there was a lot of interest in it as some might believe that it was the cause of the Hindenburg explosion. Thus, helium may have had something to do with the explosion, but I'm not saying it did, I'm just saying it might have.\nAnswer: yes\nThe problem with answering logic/reasoning questions with Yes or No is that it can be hard to get a good grade if you get all of your questions right when the answers are Yes.

        " The phones we use today have call waiting.\nAnswer: no\n7.2 Cause, Effect, and Precedence\nSometimes we make arguments that imply there is a cause that led to an effect, or that an action preceded another occurrence. Make sure you\u2019re clear about which order\u2014cause and effect, or one event before another\u2014you think you\u2019re arguing for before you make your claim. You don\u2019t want to imply you\u2019re arguing about something you\u2019re not.\nIf you\u2019re going to argue that a cause preceded an effect, and you\u2019re going to use \u201cA caused B,\u201d you should make sure you indicate the order. Your example should go something like this:\nA rose preceded the tea.\nIn your first reading, you may have thought A and B should be switched to mean \u201cthe tea caused the rose.\u201d But in the previous example, A and B were placed in the order",
        " Alexander Graham Bell is the inventor of the telephone. The telephone was invented before electronic call waiting. Thus, it is possible the phone Alexander Graham Bell used had call waiting. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nChapter 10\n# 13.4 Using Data to Provide Evidence\nIt is important for your readers to understand the strength of your claims. We need to be able to identify what information is relevant to an argument and support claims with sound evidence.\nAn important skill in the art of persuasion is that of drawing conclusions based on the information provided rather than jumping to conclusions before you have any information at all. This chapter presents guidelines for the construction of arguments that depend largely on information, evidence, or reasoning.\nIn this chapter, we examine the types of evidence that make statements specific and strong (or weak and vague). We also examine examples of evidence- or reasoning-based arguments, provide tips",
        "1969 was the year that call waiting was popularized. Alexander Graham Bell died in 1922. So there is no way he had call waiting technology, because that technology didn\u2019t exist. Thus, there was no call waiting. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: \u2705 no\nQuestion: Does the Taj Mahal have a clown?\nReasoning: A clown is an annoying person who amuses children and people of no class. Children don\u2019t go to the Taj Mahal so there are no children there. So there are no clowns at the Taj Mahal. So the answer is no.\nQuestion: Are 11:11 and 22:22 significant in some way?\nReasoning: It is possible that 11:11 is significant in an unspecified way, but at least someone at this website (this website being created by",
        "1907 is when Alexander invented the phone. Modern phones have call waiting, which is different than in 1907. Thus, the phone that Alexander Graham Bell used probably didn\u2019t have call waiting. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Are there more men named Tim (or Tom) than there are women named Sue?\nReasoning: There is no reason that there should be more men than women named Tim or Tom. There is no reason there should be more women than men named Sue, either. Therefore, there should be the same number of Tims and Sues. So the answer is no.\nQuestion: Does the earth have a solid core?\nReasoning: There is evidence that the earths core is made up of solid and liquid. Thus, there is no reason to believe it doesn\u2019t. So the answer is yes.\nQuestion: Do you have 12 ribs?\n",
        "19th century technology did not have call waiting. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Would two people of different species share a meal?\nReasoning: You can eat with someone of your own species or a closely related species. You cannot eat with two people of different species. So the answer is no.\nQuestion: Was someone arrested for impersonating a banana split?\nReasoning: Banana splits are a food item. You cannot impersonate them. 659 people were arrested for impersonating something at the zoo. Thus, the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Coulomb divided power by velocity to name his unit. What unit is he using?\nReasoning: Coulomb measures power and Velocity. Since power is measured in watts, and velocity in miles per hour, the answer must be watts per mile. However, this is not"

However, as the test creator, it is important that we understand the psychology behind test-taking so that we can improve in our efforts to improve these tests.\nThe final question above (with the red type) is an example of why this is an important consideration. Note that the last question, about holding Bing in a basket, is an ambiguous statement. It is not clear if holding Bing in a basket is impossible or possible.\nWhile it is difficult to answer this question, many test takers provided their own reasonings of what they would do if holding Bing in a basket were possible (such as, putting the basket over their shoulders and making some noise). Note also that each of the answers provided here are equally correct. If holding Bing in a basket were possible,",

        "600 kt yield of TNT has the energy of 82.6 billion joules (J). The kinetic energy of the wave would depend on the speed of sound. In air, sound travels at 343 m/s. Divide 82.6 billion J by 343 m/s to get 245 million m and multiply 245 million m by 343 m/s to get 82 million m/s or 82 megameters/second. A megameter is a million meters. A megameter-second is a megameter times a second (J/ms). So about 82 megameters, 164 megameters, 245 megameters or more would result in a shock wave over a large distance (e.g. kilometers). An explosion with an effect of 245 megameters",
        "75% of gunpowder has a low melting point. The lowest temperature at which any substance ignites is 500\u00b0C.

A year is a set of 12 months, and a month is a set of days. However, a person does not have the same birthday each day of the year; one might be born on the last day or the first day of the year. Then the birth year of Thomas Jefferson is not 1752. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no",
        "1 kilogram of gunpowder has a calorific value of 4700 kJ, which is far less than the amount of energy required to break the sound barrier (~5.5\u00d71053 J, as approximated at http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP360/contents.html).

Thus the answer is Uncertain.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Are bananas inedible?\nReasoning: All bananas will be eatable. Objects must have the property of being eatable. Things that do not have the property of being edible are not edible, and therefore are inedible. Thus, because bananas are eatable, they cannot be inedible. Thus the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Does John Gruber like Apple products?\nReasoning: John Gruber often writes favorably about Apple products. Thus, he probably likes Apple products. Therefore the answer is yes.\nAnswer: Uncertain\nQuestion: Are elephants tamed?\nReasoning",

        " Gauss had a condition called congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), which is not curable. CIPA is a rare genetic disorder due to damage on the chromosome 8, which disables sensory nerves. There are about eight people in the entire world who experience this disorder to date. CIPA could have prevented him from detecting pain, and this could explain why Gauss did not have a normal brain structure.\nAnswer: no\nWhether or not Gauss had a disorder or abnormal structure is irrelevant to our question. The question is would someone with CIPA have an abnormal brain structure.\nQuestion: Will there be an end of the world and Jesus' second coming again?\nReasoning: The second coming of Jesus implies the first coming of Jesus.

Following is a selection of such questions; some more difficult than others. Each presents a different method of how an interviewer might approach testing a candidate for a role.\nQuestion:",
        " The Canterbury Tales was written by Geoffrey Chaucer between approximately 1387 and 1400.  One Thousand and One Nights was written by Persians and/or Arabs in the Middle or Near East (Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Turkey, etc.) between approximately 800 and 1100.  Geoffrey Chaucer was born in London in approximately 1343.  Thus, it appears that it is possible that One Thousand and One Nights was written before The Canterbury Tales.  So the answer could be yes or no.\nAnswer: It is possible, but the answer is no.",
        "50 years was passed between the time Chaucer wrote The Canterbury Tales and when he wrote The Miller\u2019s Tale. Therefore, it is possible that The Canterbury Tales could have been written before the time period discussed in the question. Thus, the answer could be either Yes or No.\nAnswer: maybe\n1. For questions where the answer is yes, the reason is obvious.\n2. For questions where the answer is yes, use a direct comparison rather than an indirect comparison.\n3. For questions where the answer is no, use an indirect comparison to establish that the answer is no.\n4. You may have to provide the reader with the reasoning by stating the obvious or doing some simple counting.\nNow that you have mastered this question type, put your skills to the test by using one of the options below.\n1. Create a question that you think is a yes/no type question. Answer the question, using some",
        "1476 is the year that The Canterbury Tales was likely written. 1457 A.D. is the year that One Thousand and One Nights was written. The year difference is 19 years. Therefore, the answer is no.\nQuestion: Could the total number of atoms in all matter be a leap year?\nReasoning: There are 365 days in a year. Therefore, as mentioned in Step 1, you can answer Yes or No. The total number of atoms in matter is 1076, which is less than 1 leap year of 400. The answer is no.\nQuestion: Would a duck in the water hold an egg?\nReasoning: A duck is a bird, and birds lay eggs. So, a duck in water can hold an egg. The answer is yes.\nExample 2:\nQuestion: Do more",
        "1387 is before 1000. The Canterbury Tales was written sometime between 1387 and 1400. One Thousand and One Nights was written sometime between 800 and 1000. Thus, The Canterbury Tales was written before One Thousand and One Nights. So the answer is yes; the first question was a yes-no question.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Is it possible to construct the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio using the sine curve?\nReasoning: The sine curve can be thought of as a sequence of values. Some of those values in the sine curve correspond to the Fibonacci sequences. Other numbers in the sine curve approximate pi. The golden ratio can be expressed as a ratio of two numbers. One value of the ratio in the Fibonacci sequence is 1.6",
        "1066 AD is when The Canterbury Tales was written, and 1001 AD is when One Thousand and One Nights was written. Thus, One Thousand and One Nights was written before The Canterbury Tales. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Could you use the word \u201cspicer\u201d as an adjective?\nReasoning: The word \u201cspicer\u201d means a person who sells spices. The word \u201cperson\u201d can be an adjective. Thus, the word \u201cspicer\u201d can also be an adjective. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Is it possible to name a child \u201cOops\u201d?\nReasoning: The name \u201cOops\u201d consists of the letters \u201cO\u201d and \u201cP.\u201d \u201cO\u201d is part of the English alphabet and \u201cP\u201d is part of the English alphabet.

Soul is non-corporeal (does not have a physical body). This indicates the soul transcends time or it would exist in multiple places. Soul is non-corporeal, which indicates it transcends space. These two facts show that the soul is non-corporeal and is not bound by the physical laws by which the material world operates, which means that the time and space constraints of the physical world do not apply to the soul.

        "20,000 steps is 8.1 miles, which is only 2.9 miles to walk. A person in a cast has difficulty walking. A bodybuilder is healthy. Thus, a bodybuilder would rather not walk for 2.9 miles every day and would prefer to be in a cast for several weeks. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\n# 16\n# DISTILLING ARGUMENTS\nHear Me Out\nI would like to provide a definition of logic and a strategy for argumentation as used in the previous chapters. This chapter explores the use of logic and argumentation in the real world, especially the use of reason in the context of the law. The reason that I like this chapter is that it puts into perspective the utility of the logical concepts that we have studied in this book.\n# The Definition of Logic\nThe word _logic_ itself is defined with difficulty. Most",
        " Bodybuilders focus on strength, so they do not want to lose muscle, which a cast would do. This is because muscle needs to be continually worked to get stronger. Thus, a bodybuilder would not enjoy wearing a cast. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Do weasels eat a large number of mice?\nReasoning:   Weasels are predators. Some predators are carnivores. Predators eat other animals. Thus, weasels eat mice. The amount of mice weasels eat depends on how many there are. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Could you survive 65\u201370\u00b0C heat if you live in a temperate zone?\nReasoning: Temperate climates have temperatures between 18\u00b0C and 27\u00b0C, so they get warm during the summer, but not hot",
        "6 weeks is less than 12 weeks. Thus, a bodybuilder could not enjoy wearing a cast for 6 weeks. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\n6\u20131\nThought Experiment, Step 3: Find Similarities\nThe third step in a thought experiment is to find one or more commonalities between the two problems. We can use any of the three common types of commonalities we have explored up to this point. However, finding a direct commonality can be difficult, so often, we do not find one when looking at the questions. In this instance, there is no way to directly apply our formula to the questions. Yet, we can still develop a thought experiment that is reasonably similar to the previous problem.\nHere, we will use a slightly different approach. First, we start as we always do by identifying the question type. Next, we compare the questions in both problems. After this comparison, we",

        " Muscular strength is important for a body builder.  The stronger an athlete is, the better athlete he/she will be.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Would a bird be able to fly over a raincloud?\nReasoning: Birds must have excellent eyesight.  Their eyes must be able to see many colors  so they can track small prey.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Does a horse have an extra toe?\nReasoning: Some horses have a split hoof. If not, the answer is an immediate No. But now, if you look closely at some horses, you can see a bump. If horses had an extra toe, we might call that a bump, since it is not attached to anything. Thus, if the anatomy is slightly different from some other animal, we can also say that the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Can you make a fist with two thumbs,",
        "4-6 weeks after a bodybuilder breaks a bone, he would cast if he was in an activity (like weightlifting, running, swimming, and jumping) that could damage the bone again. 4-6 weeks is more than 2 weeks. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Has a student won a Nobel Prize for Literature?\nReasoning: Nobel Prizes are given to individuals. The Nobel Prize for Literature was established in 1901 (about 117 years). So it is too early to tell if a student has won such a prize (because he or she is less than 117 years old). Thus, we cannot determine if a student has won a Nobel Prize for Literature. So the answer is no.\nAnswer: no\nQuestion: Has a female professor ever had to use a toilet in a bathroom that does not have a sign for",
        "13 pounds (6 kg) of lead weights can be added to a pair of shoes to be an effective weight in exercise routines. Thus, 13 pounds (6 kg) of lead can lift weights. Lead weighs 11.34 pounds per gallon (5.1 kg/liter). Thus, 13 pounds (6 kg) of lead weights weigh less than a gallon of water. Thus, a bodybuilder could enjoy wearing a cast for several weeks. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nYou can think of these shortcomings as opportunities to practice your critical thinking.\nExample:\nQuestion: Could an artist enjoy an outdoor painting festival over 12 weeks in July through September?\nReasoning: To protect artists at paint-out activities in the summer, some locations provide shading tents to reduce the heat from direct sun. For protection from rain and/or extreme temper",
        "1) Bodybuilders desire to maintain their overall muscle mass and muscle tone (including the tone of their biceps and triceps) 2) Casts can increase the size of the biceps and triceps by slowing down the process by which the muscles shorten and lengthen. 3) Casts cover most of a person's body. 4) Casts are designed such that they provide little support beyond the limb on which they are placed. Thus, a bodybuilder would enjoy wearing a cast. So the answer is yes.\nAnswer: yes\nQuestion: Is it feasible for a snake to fly?\nReasoning: Some snakes are venomous, and thus must eat by catching and eating prey. 2) Snakes do not bite to defend themselves. Venomous snakes may not bite to defend themselves; rather, the snake's venom"
